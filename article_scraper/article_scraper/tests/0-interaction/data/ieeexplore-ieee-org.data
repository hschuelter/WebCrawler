Title: A behavioral approach to modeling Indian children's ability of adopting to e-learning environment

Abstract: E-Learning is making inroads into schools in India in a large scale. Making use of information and communication technology (ICT) for learning can be very effective in delivering education to masses and thereby bridging the educational divide. How far is e-learning suitable, feasible and acceptable to school children of developing country like India is a question that needs careful study. This paper reports an exploratory study of investigating a school student's perspective of acceptance of e-learning as a tool for supplementing school education. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) was used to model influence of factors like individual preferences, computer-friendliness, perceived ease-of-use, perceived usefulness, attitudes and intentions - on usage or adoption of e-learning by children. Children's mental models were analysed for understanding their beliefs and feelings towards e-learning. The results show TAM to be partially effective tool in investigating children's behavioural intention towards using e-learning. It was observed that facilitating conditions directly and strongly affected e-learning usage while intention to use e-learning was not much influential in driving the e-learning usage.

Title: Reflections on user-centered and technology-centered issues in a digital game design process: An approach to bridge the digital divide

Abstract: Researchers and game publishers consistently argue digital divide between urban and rural digital gamers in India is due to the lack of affordable and accessible technologies. In this paper, we put forward two perspectives of bridging digital divide in terms of gaming experiences namely technology and cultural perspectives. We are highlighting the potential of several existing technologies in enhancing the gaming experiences of rural and semi-urban populations of India. In addition, we also emphasize on the importance of cultural differences in designing the delivery content for the digital games. We argue that the widely discussed digital divide can be mitigated by considering both technological aspects and cross-cultural aspects of the target users.

Title: Keynote speech I: Beyond multi-touch: Interactive surfaces that support haptic feedback and multiple independent views

Abstract: Summary form only given. Although Multi-touch devices have become common in the consumer world, users have sacrificed the tactile feedback afforded by physical buttons. The Bristol Interaction and Graphics group has been exploring various technical solutions to create the next generation of touch interfaces that support multi-point haptic feedback as well as dynamic allocation of views to different users. In this talk I will present UltraHaptics a multi-point haptic feedback system that allows users to experience haptic feedback simultaneously in multiple locations on an interactive surface. This feedback is created in midair - so users don't have to touch or hold any device to experience it. Another system I will be talking about it PiVOT, a tabletop system where users can come together and view shared content or by leaning forward can get personalised views that are only visible from their particular view-point. This talk will present our recent research endeavors in this direction and present some design challenges.

Title: Development of multimodal user interfaces to Internet for common people

Abstract: In recent years, there is a rapid advancement in Information and Communication Technology (ICT). However, the explosive growth of ICT and its many applications in education, health, agriculture etc. are confined to a limited number of privileged people, who live in digital pockets. We term these underprivileged people as common people, who are digitally illiterate as well as language illiterate. According to the UNESCO report, population of such people in the globe is 64% and in developing countries like in India, China etc. it is around 76%. It is therefore an urgent need to include this large set of population in the ICT revolution. This issue has been addressed in this paper and we propose to develop a solution in ICT for common people. We propose a multimodal interface mechanism to Internet so that common people can interact to Internet with their mother languages, speech and icons. The proposed approach has been tested with people in India and results are presented.

Title: Natural arrangement: A novel and intuitive perspective on filesystem re-organization

Abstract: Proper semantic categorization and organization of filesystem is the key to find files and folders later easily. There is a significant role of rearrangement of files between different folders by cut/copy and paste while organizing a filesystem. Conventional file browsers have only unidirectional file copy system where a file can be copied only between one folder to another at a time. However, there are three more kinds of such rearrangement exist; between one-to-many folders, many-to-one folder and many-to-many folders. The limitations of unidirectional copy of existing file browsers require the user to simulate many-to-one folder rearrangement by doing one-to-one folder copy repeatedly. Whereas, the natural strategy to copy items in a many-to-one relation is to pick up items from each source and then copy them together into the destination. This paper describes a novel file browser design that implements the natural strategy of file copy between many-to-one folders. It also discusses the efficiency of the scheme compared to conventional file browsers by a KLM-GOMS model analysis.

Title: Gardener: A file browser assistant to help users maintaining semantic folder hierarchy

Abstract: Users, especially beginners, have problem finding files from large, ever growing filesystem. Common practice is to memorize the pathnames of frequently accessed folders and files which increases the cognitive load while file browsing. A suitable solution is to have a semantic hierarchy among folders so that the users can use reasoning instead of memorizing pathnames while file browsing. However, users are usually reluctant to put files in their proper places each time a file is saved. Thus, practically maintaining a Semantic Folder Hierarchy in a large filesystem is hard. This article proposes a file browser assistant “Gardener” which helps the user to maintain the Semantic Folder Hierarchy Tree in a filesystem by suggesting a suitable location each time a new file is created. The User Interface also has a “Single Click Save” option that eliminates the need to browse the filesystem and reduces interaction time. Although indirectly, this assistance for maintaining Semantic Folder Hierarchy eventually reduces the cognitive load of the users while finding files in a filesystem.

Title: A taxonomy of handheld augmented reality applications

Abstract: This paper provides a straightforward layer based taxonomy for categorizing research and development in handheld augmented reality (HAR) applications. The taxonomy provides a framework for articulating and differentiation of research and development specific to HAR applications within a visual model. A literature review is used to place examples of previous research into the model. In addition we show two use cases where we illustrate how we use the taxonomy to position our own current research into the model. We conclude that the model enables a more focused view on topics specific for HAR within the field of AR.

Title: Icon-based representation of web information

Abstract: With the target of free knowledge distribution a vast information repository is build up in Web. People are able to access and share these information through Internet. It helps people to enrich their knowledge base as well as to get quick suggestions of any problem. But this opportunity is only limited to the educated people those who have good reading, writing and comprehending capability of language specifically English language. To overcome this limitation we choice icon as the expression medium and propose a methodology to visually represent Web information which helps illiterate or semi-illiterate people to get some basic information of a Web page. Few experiments have been performed to check the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The experimental result substantiates the efficacy of the proposal.

Title: Estimation of Saccadic Ratio from eye image sequences to detect human alertness

Abstract: Saccadic Ratio (SR), a ratio between Peak Saccadic Velocity and the Saccadic Duration, exhibits correlation with human alertness. A simple non-linear model of horizontal saccade with input as the position of pupil center relative to the corners is proposed. The relative position of pupil center is initially determined using recently developed method based on horizontal, and vertical form factors and edge detection method based on local form factor. An Extended Kalman filter based algorithm has been developed to estimate the saccadic velocity and the saccadic ratio from this initial information for eye image video database captured with a speed higher than 60 fps. A Kalman filter based technique is also applied on the same database and the results are compared with that of the proposed method. Correlation of SR with a questionnaire based alertness assessment index is investigated. The experimental results indicate that the estimated SR by the proposed method is highly correlated with state of human alertness.

Title: A vicinity activation model for intelligent interface in tele-operation

Abstract: A machine hosted intelligent operator interface is essential for `man in loop' type tele-operated systems with slave located away from the master-side-operator. A fluidics inspired model has been devised to support intelligent human-machine interface on master side of such system. The model is used to activate robot's work environment by encoding workspace. It is instrumental in creation of active response to human operator through intelligent interface based on slave robot's dynamic state and spatial context in workspace. Experimental work for creating augmented perception of vicinity around approachable and unapproachable parts in effective ways and multimode operator interface formation too has been carried out.

Title: Towards establishing a mute communication: An Indian Sign Language perspective

Abstract: To automate the communication between a deaf and a hearing person, both channels i.e. from deaf to hearing and vice-versa must be emphasized equally. Sign Language Recognition System helps to understand the sign language gestures made by a deaf, while a Sign Language Animation System enables a deaf person to interpret a hearing person who does not know sign language. In this survey, various techniques to implement these two systems are explored and compared separately. Though Indian Sign language (ISL) is in focus, research work in other sign languages is explored as well.

Title: Towards better real-time control of smart wheelchair using subtle finger movements via wireless (blue-tooth) interface

Abstract: This study investigates the design of a novel realtime system to control a smart wheelchair using subtle finger movements. Surface electromyography (sEMG) signals from the forearm recorded during muscle onset activation were used as the control signals. A set of time domain (TD) and wavelet features were extracted from sEMG signals. Wavelet singularities based on the volume conduction muscle model were computed to provide precise control to the system. A simple multilayer perceptron artificial neural network (ANN) is applied for classification of these features. The output of the classifier was used as a control signal to test a small miniaturized wheelchair in realtime via wireless (blue-tooth) interface. Wavelet decomposition singularities in association with an ANN classifier can successfully differentiate between five different subtle finger movements with a high degree of sensitivity. This research study is a framework towards providing a simple and better control and interface for amputees, disabled and elderly, who have limited mobility.

Title: Convenient and elegant HCI features of PFBR operator consoles for safe operation

Abstract: Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor (PFBR) is liquid Sodium cooled, mixed oxide fuelled, fast breeder reactor being built in Kalpakkam, India. This is a first of its kind in India by which we enter into the second stage of the 3-stage nuclear program in commercial scale. Three layered Distributed Digital Control System (DDCS) architecture was decided to be implemented for this reactor. The Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the Central Control Room in the DDCS architecture is to be developed using Qt. Considering the importance of safety in Nuclear Plants, the GUI of PFBR has to be safe, simple and unambiguous.

Title: An innovative proposal to increase the efficacy of the Automated Teller Machine using mobile banking

Abstract: The focus of this paper is to propose an innovative method to reduce the service time of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM). Irrespective of the number of identical servers (machines) in an ATM centre, if the service time of an ATM gets reduced, then it will also have proportional reduction in queue time and queue length. Here, we intend to propose a concept of Virtual Pre-Transaction (VPT) using mobile banking for withdrawing money through ATM. Using this VPT, we can register the amount to be withdrawn from ATM even before physically moving to any ATM centre. This leads to reduction in the task to be done inside ATM cabin. As a result, there is a considerable reduction in service time and queue time as recorded in our experimental analysis.

Title: VoiceMail architecture in desktop and mobile devices for the Blind people

Abstract: The advancement in computer based accessible systems has opened up many avenues for the visually impaired across a wide majority of the globe. Audio feedback based virtual environment like, the screen readers have helped Blind people to access internet applications immensely. However, a large section of visually impaired people in different countries in particular, the Indian sub-continent could not benefit much from such systems. This was primarily due to the difference in the technology required for Indian languages compared to those corresponding to other popular languages of the world. In this paper, we describe the VoiceMail system architecture that can be used by a Blind person to access e-Mails easily and efficiently. The contribution made by this research has enabled the Blind people to send and receive voice based e-Mail messages in their native language with the help of a computer or a mobile device. Our proposed system GUI has been evaluated against the GUI of a traditional mail server. We found that our proposed architecture performs much better than that of the existing GUIs.

Title: Interactive diagnosis of nevus' classification using FWS model & feature-based analysis

Abstract: A Computer-Assisted Diagnostic System for Decision-making in early detection of the nevus as either benign or dysplastic or melanocytic, was developed with dynamic features of Analysis and design. The system, presents a Feature-based Classification Module combined with a new model called Fourier-Wavelet-Statistical (FWS), supported by the heuristic knowledge for Image Analysis. The design of the system is divided into 3 stages: The FWS model, Classification Module & Interactive Interface. The FWS Model was Comprised of 3 Parallel sub-blocks to which the image is fed, viz., the Edge-Axis algorithm, Multi-level Discrete Wavelet Transforms (MDWT) Process Algorithm & the Statistical Node. The Classification module was designed with a Classifier & Knowledge Data Base (KDB) that follows a Heuristic approach in identifying the nevus as of specific type. The Interactive Interface block is a challenging concept to the designer in handling the collective perspectives of experts, practitioners, and engineers. The design model is efficient, in improving the decision-making strategy and overall accuracy of the system developed; in order to assist a general practitioner in identifying the typical skin lesion under a suggestive and supportive environment.

Title: EyeBoard: A fast and accurate eye gaze-based text entry system

Abstract: Over the last three decades, eye gaze has become an important modality of text entry in large and small display digital devices covering people with disabilities beside the able-bodied. Despite of many tools being developed, issues like dwell time optimization, visual search time and interface area minimization, eye-controlled mouse movement stability etc. are still points of concern in making any gaze typing interface more user friendly, accurate and robust. In this paper, we propose EyeBoard, an gaze-based text entry system which optimizes the constituent virtual keyboard layout with respect to eye gaze movement as well as adjusts dwell time dynamically in accordance with user comfort level. Performance evaluation shows that proposed interface achieves on an average 14% higher text entry rate over the existing interfaces. As designed, the proposed interface can effortlessly be suited in small display devices like Mobile phone, PDA etc. Although the experiments have been conducted with able-bodied users, those can easily be replicated for people having severe motor disabilities.

Title: Web personalization in technology acceptance

Abstract: This paper studies the role of web personalization in technology acceptance in consumer context. Web personalization has been extensively studied in various research streams. We try to study the effect of web personalization in context of technology acceptance. Most previous studies on web personalization have focused on e-commerce. We choose our domain of study as E Governance which has received much less research attention, particularly on user behavior and web personalization. We use Consumer Acceptance and use of Information Technology (UTAUT2) as the model to study consumer acceptance of an online government service channel. We follow a randomized experimental design to test how web personalization moderates the impact of performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions, hedonic motivation, price and habit on consumer's intention to use a technology.

Title: GeCCo: Finger gesture-based command and control for touch interfaces

Abstract: With touch-based interfaces becoming commonplace on personal computing devices ranging from phones and slates to notebook and desktop PCs, a number of common tasks that were once performed using mouse or keyboard input now need to be performed using fingers on the touch surface. Finger-drawn gestures offer a viable alternative to desktop and keyboard shortcuts as shortcuts for common tasks such as launching of applications and navigation of large media collections. In order to be truly effective, the interface for definition, management and invocation of gestures should be highly intuitive, and optimized for the device. In particular, the process of invoking gestures should be seamless and natural. Further, the recognition of gestures needs to be robust for the specific user. In this paper, we describe GeCCo (Gesture Command and Control), a system for personalized finger gesture shortcuts for touch-enabled desktops and trackpad-enabled notebook PCs. One of the key issues addressed in the design of GeCCo is that of mode switching in the context of notebook PCs. We describe a user study to decide between different interactions for mode switching. The interactions are designed such that mode switch and gesture can be simultaneously indicated. Since new gestures may be defined by the user at any time, statistical pattern classification techniques which require large numbers of training samples for each gesture are not useful. Instead we use nearest-neighbor classification with Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance, and a writer adaptation scheme for improving accuracy to desired levels. We conclude the paper with experimental results and some thoughts on next steps.

Title: Efficient navigation in virtual environments: A comparative study of two interaction techniques: The Magic Wand vs. the Human Joystick

Abstract: Whether it is for entertainment, training, medical, architectural, among other purposes, virtual environments are having a salient, real impact into many facets of our lives. A common user interaction task within such environments is movement. Several solutions have been proposed in the past for different environments. We are presenting a novel variation of two known interaction techniques and evaluate them in terms of efficiency and user experience in an immersive, virtual supermarket. Results indicate that although one is more efficient than the other they do not differ in terms of experiential aspects.

Title: BlindGuide: An audio based eyes-free caller guide for people with visual impairment

Abstract: BlindGuide is a caller system for mobile phone devices designed to provide sightless access to the blind people. Blind people can enter any phone number and also can search any name from contact list to make call to other person. Users interact to the system using five physical keys present in phone keypad. We provide an audio guideline to use BlindGuide and an auditory feedback against each unit interaction to ensure users about their inputs. BlindGuide does not require touch screen so, it can save the extra cost added for handset due to touch-screen device. BlindGuide requires less number of physical keys (with respect to QWERTY keypad or traditional telephone keypad) which favors to provide higher tactile sensitivity. We present our design rationale followed by an explorative evaluation of BlindGuide with experienced trainer of visually impaired students.

Title: Temporal correlation and probabilistic prediction based face detection framework in real time environment

Abstract: Conventionally, the object detection algorithm proposed by Viola Jones (using Haar-like features, Integral image and AdaBoost algorithm) is implemented in majority of the face detection applications. In this article, an improvement to the application of Viola Jones algorithm in real time environment is presented by exploiting the analogy between video motion estimation and continuous object detection. Using the temporal correlation between successive frames of a real time input, various modifications improving the robustness and computational complexity of face detection are proposed. The proposed method focuses on reducing the search area for face detection on the basis of probabilistic prediction. In addition, approximation of minimum face size renders an improved performance. The modified Face Detection Framework (FDF) is applied in two scenarios, canned video sequences from public databases and real time inputs from a low resolution camera, yielding improved results in both the cases.

Title: Event Indicator Function classifier for identifying cell tracking errors and phenotypes

Abstract: Biologists estimate parameters such as division time, death time, time to differentiate into specialized cell in order to model cell behavior and to develop novel ways to fight diseases such as Cancer, HIV and others. One of the critical steps of such analysis of cells in video microscopy is to follow each of the cells through their generations and collect relevant information. Variability of cell density and dynamics in different video, hamper portability of existing automated cell tracking systems across videos. These errors have to be identified and corrected using human assistance to achieve tracker portability across videos. In this paper, we propose Event Indicator Function (EIF) classifier to predict the tracking errors and cell phenotypes (division and death) frame-by-frame using a set of features (metrics) that are collected during tracking. EIF classifier models the metrics using empirical thresholds to identify the errors and phenotypes. Finally, EIF classifier performance has been evaluated on variety of microscopic videos that differ both in cell density and dynamics, illustrated results show the significance of the proposed classifier.

Title: Modified Demons deformation algorithm for non-rigid image registration

Abstract: Image registration is a technique used for aligning two different images taken at different times and/or from different viewing and different imaging setups/modalities. A key challenge for medical image registration is to minimize computation time and reduce alignment errors. The Demons deformation algorithm has been used extensively for deformation medical images for image registration. In this paper we present modifications to Demons deformation algorithm that reduce runtime while giving good deformation.

Title: Application of Complete Local Binary Pattern Method for facial expression recognition

Abstract: We propose a novel approach using Complete Local Binary Pattern feature generation method for facial expression recognition with the help of Multi-Class Support Vector Machine. Complete Local Binary Pattern method is an extended version of Local Binary Pattern method with a little difference. LBP feature considers only signs of local differences, whereas CLBP feature considers both signs and magnitude of local differences as well as original center gray level value. CLBP and LBP have same computational complexity while CLBP performs better facial expression recognition over LBP using SVM training and multiclass classification with binary SVM classifiers. The experimental result demonstrate the average efficiency of recognition of propose method (35 images) with CLBP is 86.4%, while with LBP and CCV is 84.1255% and 75.83% in the JAFFE database.

Title: A real time facial expression classification system using Local Binary Patterns

Abstract: Facial expression analysis is one of the popular fields of research in human computer interaction (HCI). It has several applications in next generation user interfaces, human emotion analysis, behavior and cognitive modeling. In this paper, a facial expression classification algorithm is proposed which uses Haar classifier for face detection purpose, Local Binary Patterns(LBP) histogram of different block sizes of a face image as feature vectors and classifies various facial expressions using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The algorithm is implemented in real time for expression classification since the computational complexity of the algorithm is small. A customizable approach is proposed for facial expression analysis, since the various expressions and intensity of expressions vary from person to person. The system uses grayscale frontal face images of a person to classify six basic emotions namely happiness, sadness, disgust, fear, surprise and anger.

Title: Simple and intelligent system to recognize the expression of speech-disabled person

Abstract: The objective of this work is to recognize 40 basic hand gestures. The main features used are centroid in the hand, presence of thumb and number of peaks in the hand gesture. The algorithm is based on the shape based features by keeping in the mind that shape of human hand is same for all human beings except in some situations. The hand gestures are captured and stored in the disk. The stored images converted into binary images and then pre-processing is performed to eliminate noise using Otsu's method. The features are extracted using vision based hand gesture recognition techniques. On the basis of these features a five bit binary sequence is generated. The classification is performed by rule based classification approach. The algorithm is tested for 40 different hand gestures with the database of 200 images taken from a simple camera of 3.2 mega pixels.

Title: Designing an intelligent blink analyzer tool for effective human computer interaction through eye

Abstract: The traditional human-computer interfaces demand good manual agility and refined motor control, which may be absent or unpredictable for people with certain disabilities. Here it is proposed a robust, accurate algorithm with relevant hardware setup to detect eyes and measure the duration of blinks to interpret them in real time to control a computer or computer interfaced devices. The complete system is divided into two primary modules. The first one is to detect voluntary eye blink and second module to trigger an onscreen soft agent that interprets the blink into proper mouse movement with associated mouse action sequence. This is a low cost proposal and prototypes designed to work with web camera interfaced to a standard PC.

Title: Eyeball and blink controlled firing system for military tank using LabVIEW

Abstract: Presently, most of the modern military tanks require 4 members to operate. In this paper, we try to reduce the number of persons to operate the tank by one and increase the ease of targeting enemies. This is achieved by controlling the firing systems of the tank with the help of eyeball movement and blink. Image of the eye is captured using a camera, which is placed in front of the eye, and centroid of the iris is found to track the eye. The turret's vertical as well as horizontal position is controlled using the eyeball movement and the gun can be fired with the help of blink. It is possible to switch between the main gun and the machine gun with ease. The machine gun is also controlled in a similar manner. Thus, our system allows the driver to control the tank as well as the firing system thereby reducing number of people to control the tank.

Title: Diagnosing of the lungs status using morphological anomalies of the signals in transformed domain

Abstract: Lung sound (LS) contains information regarding the lungs status. Medical practitioners listen to these sounds using stethoscope and make interpretation. This procedure is known as auscultation which totally depends on the physicians experience and knowledge. There is a probability of misinterpretation due to human factor involved. In this paper, we propose a method based on complexity measuring theorem that can give reliable diagnosis of LS in an automated environment. The developed algorithm detects the lung conditions by calculating the sample entropy value of the frequency spectrum. The results are evaluated through statistical analysis and corroborated by a pulmonologist. The technique could be very useful in developing assisting device for medical professionals.

Title: Human computer interface design for neonatal intensive care with data mining

Abstract: Neonatal Intensive care Unit (NICU) is capable of caring newborns and premature babies during their first four weeks of life. This could help to improve child mortality rate because 41% of all child death is reported during their neonatal period. Hence, a state of art modern Neonatal Intensive Care Unit is a prime need of any nation in order to improve child health and subsequently for socio economic development of a country like India. A Neonatal Intensive care Unit (NICU) consist multiple life saving machines which are continuously recording vital parameters of neonates and generating vast data at very high frequency. A context aware based timely monitoring of such systems is a crucial task which could able to help medical experts for efficient decision making. Considering multiple vital parameters and taking decision in a real time situation could be more improved by having efficient decision support system based on strong human computer interaction. In this present research work a human computer interface for Neonatal Intensive Care Unit has been proposed which utilizes Support Vector Machine to classify the health condition of neonates. A prognostic Index has been proposed which could be calculated on the basis of seven important vital parameters. Based on the value of Prognostic Index clinical rules may be identified to initiate alarms about the neonate health condition.

Title: Assistive learning environment for students with Learning Disabilities

Abstract: Students with Learning Disabilities (LD) have diverse difficulties, often hidden or subtle, that affect learning throughout their life. As each LD learner tends to have specific needs that must be addressed; therefore the traditional learning environment cannot cope with the accessible and adaptive constraints of LD. These difficulties can be abridged by providing appropriate learning environment for them. We propose a path forward to build an Assistive Learning Environment (ALE) to enhance the learning experience of LD students in their academic life. The proposed architecture is at its initial stage of the research and may be refined in the future.

Title: Effect of sleep deprivation on estimated distributed sources for Scalp EEG signals: A case study on human drivers

Abstract: The Scalp EEG is a large-scale & robust information source about neocortical dynamic functions. In this paper, we analyze a scalp Electro-Encephalogram (EEG) database of 12 human subjects driving on a simulated condition in laboratory, in 11 different stages of fatigue for characterizing the source natures on the cortex surface. In this paper, the Linear Distributed Current Dipole Approach is used. We have used standardized Low Resolution Brain Electromagnetic Tomography (sLORETA) algorithm, which upon construction of a Lead-field Matrix or a Head model consisting of a grid of 10014 voxels, spatially maps the surface data to corresponding corticular dipole sources at each voxel. The information measures such as Renyi, Shannon & Tsallis entropies of the scouts or voxels nearest to specific electrodes are calculated for various subjects & for varying fatigue levels.

Title: A biomedical approach to retrieve information on driver's fatigue by integrating EEG, ECG and blood biomarkers during simulated driving session

Abstract: A critical analysis of physical fatigue from prolonged driving in real time and subsequent scoring will be a boon for transport sector to prevent road traffic accidents. The current study has two objectives, first, to conduct a multidimensional analysis of central and physical components of fatigue in drivers during simulated driving session and second, to find the rationality of each assessed parameter to be used for scoring system. Briefly, 12 skilled drivers were subjected to simulated driving session for 32-hours. An EEG and an ECG were obtained from each subject at 3-hours interval to assess central and peripheral components of driver's fatigue respectively. EEG data were analyzed to obtain the variation in relative energy of all frequency bands while ECG data were used to study heart rate variability(HRV) at progressive stages of fatigue. Concurrently, blood samples of each subject were analyzed for key blood biomarkers(random blood sugar, blood urea and creatinine) at 8-hours interval. The relative-energy of θ, α and β-bands increased most significantly at Cz electrode while the variations across the stages was most significant in a derived band i.e. α+θ / δ1-δ2 followed by that of θ-band. The power distribution in high frequency components of ECG showed a distinct decreasing trend with advancing fatigue. All blood biomarkers increased with duration of driving task that was significant across the stages. Thus, an effective scoring of drivers' fatigue can be obtained by integrating EEG parameters with HRV and blood biomarkers that can validate fatigue detecting devices under development.

Title: Interference-aware channel switching for use in WBAN with human-sensor interface

Abstract: A Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) consists of different medical sensors connected to an on-body coordinator through a wireless medium. The sensors are placed over a human body for continuous monitoring of physiological parameters. The information sensed by the nodes are transmitted to the on-body coordinator. Upon receiving these information from the sensor nodes, the coordinator transmits the same to the medical server for post data analysis. Any radio frequency based wireless device suffers from interference due to the existence of other wireless devices operating in the same licence-free frequency band. In this paper, we address the problem of interference when multiple WBANs come in the proximity of one another. In such a scenario, the WBAN senses the existence of other interfering WBANs, based on the Signal-to-Interference Ratio (SIR). We propose an interference-aware channel switching algorithm (InterACS) for WBANs, so that there is seamless communication with their sensors without interference among them. We simulated the proposed solution using the NS-3 network simulator and observed that there is improvement in reducing the number of interferences by using the proposed solution scheme.

Title: Can a paper-based sketching interface improve the gamer experience in strategy computer games?

Abstract: The field of sketching interface design in regards to video game is relatively young and has not been investigated in great depth. Freepad is a custom paper-based MIDI musical interface. We describe an extension to Freepad that supports user customization for real time strategy games. Using only a webcam, a pen and a sheet of paper, players can design their own interface by drawing shapes and linking them to simple or complex actions in the game. In an user study, we use this extended Freepad to explore the potential of sketching interfaces in strategy video games. Our results indicate that using Freepad improves the efficiency of players and their enjoyment in this kind of games.

Title: Advanced Network Technologies Virtual Lab: A Human-Computer Interface for performing experiments on Wireless Sensor Networks

Abstract: Research analysis manifest clear trends of growing interest of the field of Human Computer Interaction (HCI) towards virtualized learning. To keep up this trend, as well as the pace with the rapid advancement of software technologies, the Advanced Network Technologies Virtual Lab (ANT VLab) has been developed by us at Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India. This lab exposes students to various advanced topics including Wi-Fi, WiMAX, Satellite Networks, Mobile Adhoc Networks (MANETs), Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), Bluetooth, Zigbee, and encourages them to work on related problems in a partially constrained environment. Apart from providing detailed theory on each topic, each virtual experiment in the lab has a set of exercises to be solved using remote network simulations. Network Simulator-2 (NS-2) / Mannasim framework and Network Simulator-3 (NS-3) have been used for this purpose. The ANT VLab also offers benefits such as reduced software and hardware costs as against setting up an actual advanced network technology lab, improved learning by interactive visualization, and self-learning advanced network technologies in the absence of a real-life instructor. Additionally, the students can interface and learn at their own pace any time and from any place having a PC with high speed Internet connectivity. WSNs is an emerging field in computer networking. In this paper, we discuss the development of a module for WSNs, that can be used for performing different WSNs experiments in the virtual mode.

In the context of Indian language, in addition to large alphabets sizes there are a lot of phonetically or graphically similar characters which needs more time to search the desired characters and occasionally leads to taping wrong characters. This issue can be addressed by highlighting the next probable characters and thus offering visual clue and mitigating errors. The proposed approach not only help in avoiding the error, it also highlight the required character when user have misspelled part of word while composing text.

Title: Single channel electrooculogram(EOG) based interface for mobility aid

Abstract: Human computer interfacing (HCI) technology has emerged as a new pathway towards the improvement of different rehabilitative aids. In this paper, new approach to control the motorized human computer interface using electrooculogram (EOG) is proposed. A mobility interface controlled by eye movements has been developed to help the disabled individuals with motor impairment who cannot even speak. Electrooculogram(EOG) is the potential generated in due the movement of the eyeballs and can be acquired from the surrounding region of eye socket. The signal is easy to acquire noninvasively and has a simple pattern. A low cost data acquisition system for EOG is designed. Horizontal electrooculographic signal is recorded by placing electrodes at the outer region of the orbit of eyes, and a reference electrode at neck. Using different combinations of eye movements in right and left direction a simple control strategy has been developed to drive motors. Control signals have been first generated using 8051 microcontroller. To meet the problems occurred while using 8051, ATMEGA microcontroller has been adapted. Directional movements of a small prototype of mobility aid (a toy car) with DC motors in right, left and forward is controlled and start and stop of movement is also implemented with ATMEGA. These control signals can be further used to command rehabilitative assistive device with eye movement sequences.

Title: Freehand pose-based Gestural Interaction: Studies and implications for interface design

Abstract: Most work on Freehand Gestural Interaction has focused on high-energy expressive interfaces for expert user. In this work, we examine the use of hand poses in laid-back freehand gestural interactions for novice users and examine the factors that impact gesture performance. Through two Wizard-of-Oz studies, one leading to the other, we observe how novice users behave under relaxed conditions. The first study explores the ease of use of a pose-based hand gesture vocabulary in the context of a photo-browsing task, and examines some of the key factors that impact the performance of such pose based gestures. The second explores pose-based interaction techniques for widget manipulation tasks. These studies reveal that while hand poses have the potential to expand the vocabulary of gestures and are easy to recall and use, there are a number of issues that show up in actual performance related to inadvertent modifications in hand pose and hand trajectories. We summarize the implications of these findings for the design of pose-based freehand gestural interfaces, which we believe would be useful for both interaction designers and gesture recognition researchers.

Title: A survey on mobile text entry handedness: How do users input text on handheld devices while nomadic?

Abstract: This paper presents results of a survey that explored users' typing handedness in various mobile settings, such as while walking, while commuting, and while driving. Results show that a substantial number of users input text on their handheld devices while walking (48%) and while commuting (90%). About half of these users use both hands, while the rest half use either their dominant or non-dominant hand to type. Single-hand text entry users usually use their dominant hand to type. Most mobile text entry users continue inputting text in situations where they have only one hand available to type. In such situations, however, the number of users who prefer using their non-dominant hand increases significantly. About half of the users who drive (58%), frequently input text while driving. In this case, however, most users (92%) prefer using their dominant hand to input text.

Title: Influence of learning styles and academic achievement on performance and preference in different learning modes: An adaptive hypermedia approach

Abstract: This paper examines the efficacy of Felder-Silverman's learning styles and Mayer's generative theory of multimedia learning for adaptive hypermedia using three different modes of presentations-verbal, visual, and multimedia- in history and engineering disciplines. Six modules in history and engineering were designed in verbal, visual and multimedia modes. Hundred and four undergraduate students of the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur participated and completed the six modules. The performance in each module was assessed on the basis of recall, recognition, comprehension, and transfer of learning. Based on Inventory of Learning Styles, learners were categorized in visual-verbal and sequential-global dimensions. The verbal, neutral, and visual learners and the sequential, neutral, and global learners did not differ in performance across disciplines. Learners' performance in visual mode for history and in multimedia mode for engineering was found to be superior to other modes. High academic achievers performed better for recognition and comprehension dimensions in history, and recognition dimension in engineering than low academic achievers. Irrespective of learning styles or academic achievements students preferred and found more appropriate visual and multimedia modes over verbal mode of learning. We believe that the null results for learning styles suggest their limited usability for adaptive hypermedia. Similarly, Mayer's multimedia learning cannot be recommended as the most effective mode of learning for all disciplines. We suggest that adaptivity according to disciplines is an important area that needs to be explored.

Title: Pitch based selection of optimal search space at runtime: Speaker recognition perspective

Abstract: Large scale speaker recognition (SR) applications demand efficient design strategy with smart optimization technique to enhance the real-time usability. Runtime selection of optimal search space can reduce the computational cost involved in this respect. This paper describes a multilayer design layout with a novel Pitch Based Dynamic Pruning (PBDP) algorithm to optimize VQ and GMM based close-set SR process. The process involves runtime selection of most likely speakers based on percentage of cumulative pitch occurrence frequencies within certain pitch ranges selected from the test utterance followed by a spectral matching using MFCC features within the reduced search space. Experiments on YOHO and NIST2008 corpus reveal that nearly 40% of the total identification time is being saved with slight (below 0.5%) increase or even decrease in average error rate. Proposed pruning method can also be applicable for selection of most likely flexible background in unconstrained cohort normalization task of verification problem.

Title: A novel approach in feature level for robust text-independent speaker identification system

Abstract: Over the decade, mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) has been the most popular feature extraction method in the field of automatic speaker recognition. But in case of robust speaker recognition system, its performance is good for white noise contamination but not as good for other noises. We introduce speech-signal-based frequency cepstral coefficients (SFCC) in speaker recognition domain. In this method, frequency warping function is derived directly from the speech signal itself by considering equal area portions of the logarithm of the ensemble average short-time power spectrum of entire speech corpus. Speech-signal-based frequency warping function is very much similar to the frequency scale obtained through psycho-acoustic experiments known as mel scale and bark scale. We have proposed to use combination of filter banks of both the MFCC and SFCC in text-independent speaker identification. Speaker identification experiments are performed on POLY-COST database. The proposed technique gives better performance than the single streamed MFCC or SFCC based features for robust speaker identification system.

Title: Multi-document summarization using sentence clustering

Abstract: This paper presents an approach to query focused multi document summarization by combining single document summary using sentence clustering. Both syntactic and semantic similarity between sentences is used for clustering. Single document summary is generated using document feature, sentence reference index feature, location feature and concept similarity feature. Sentences from single document summaries are clustered and top most sentences from each cluster are used for creating multi-document summary. We observed an average F-measure of 0.33774 on DUC 2002 multi-document dataset, which is comparable to three best performing systems reported on the same dataset.

Title: The intonation of Bangla sentences: Declarative, Wh-questions and yes/no by using Empirical Mode of Decomposition

Abstract: This paper investigates the intonational properties of different types of sentence by using EMD analysis of Bangla language. The study is about yes/no questions, wh-questions and declarative sentences. The speech material used for the present study is 45 read utterances recorded in laboratory conditions. The result shows that the intonation pattern for declarative sentences is falling, wh-questions also follow the same intonation pattern as declarative, but for yes/no it's rising. The other parameters of intonation pattern such as stressed word and intermediate phrase also studied. The results of EMD analysis is then compared with the Bangla grammar and Fujisaki model, which are satisfactory.

Title: Identification of Nominal Multiword Expressions in Bengali using CRF

Abstract: One of the key issues in both natural language understanding and generation is the appropriate processing of Multiword Expressions (MWEs). MWEs pose a huge problem to a precise language processing due to their idiosyncratic nature and diversity in lexical, syntactical and semantic properties. The semantic of a MWE can be expressed transparently or opaquely after combining the semantic of its constituents. This paper deals with the identification of Nominal Multiword Expressions in the Bengali text using Conditional Random Field (CRF) machine learning technique. Bengali is highly agglutinative and morphologically rich language. Thus the selection of features such as surrounding words, POS tag, prefix, suffix, length etc are proved to be very effective for running the CRF tool for the identification of Nominal MWEs. Compared to the statistical system built in Bengali language for compound noun MWEs identification, our proposed system shows higher accuracy in terms of precision, recall and F-score. We also conclude that with the identification of Reduplicated MWEs (RMWEs) and considering it as a feature makes reasonable improvement compared to the earlier system.

Title: Cost of error correction quantification with Bengali text transcription

Abstract: Text based interaction in user mother language becomes one of the most primitive and usable interaction technique with the gigantic growth of the digital communication application like e-mailing, messaging, chatting, blogging etc. Efficiency of a text entry technology mainly depends on text entry rate and error rate. Number of errors occurs during typing are generally measured by Levenshtein minimum string distance (MSD) statistic. It counts the number of error present in transcribed text concerning presented text and quantifies the numbers of single edit operation required to transform transcribed text to presented text. It reckons one single edit operation for one error. However, it is not applicable to Indian languages to error correction operation quantification due to language-related features like - complex (`juktakkhor') and matra characters. As single error in a complex character may required multiple single edit operations to correct. The error on complex character is basically confined the practical usefulness of MSD quantification method in Indian language scenario. In this paper, we quantify the minimum number of single edit primitive required to correct the errors in Indian language transcribed text typed by any single stroke or tap text entry tool. To accomplish our objective, initially, we identify the mismatched character (error) positions in both transcribed and presented text both by employing longest common subsequence (LCS) algorithm. Then, we proposed an algorithm to identify whether error in simple character or in complex character. After that, we propose another algorithm to calculate the minimum number of operations to renovate transcribed to presented text depending upon error positions and type (error in simple or complex character). Lastly, we define correction cost per error (CCPE) metric to calculate average correction cost for an erroneous transcribed text.

Title: Functionality or user interface: Which is easier to learn when changed?

Abstract: The rapid release model of software introduces frequent updates to the existing software every twelve-eighteen weeks, forcing a user to get accustomed to its new features. We propose an experimental study to compare the learning gaps that are introduced when a user is exposed to a new version of a software, with which he is previously acquainted. In order to explore the problem, we propose four models of a machine, with each model involving an update either to the functionality, or to the user interface, or both. We conducted a between-subjects experimental study with thirty-two participants who performed two tasks successively on two models of a machine, the second one being a updated model of the first. The analysis of the data using ANOVA implies that a change in the user interface dominates a change in the functionality. Results indicate that 88% of the errors were caused due to a change in the user interface. 87.5% of the users who underwent a change in the user interface hold this change responsible for the learning gap, while only 56.25% users who underwent a change in the functionality consider it to be a potential reason for the learning gap.

Title: The model of happyability

Abstract: These terms “functionality”, “usability” and “pleasurability” are being studied for many years. There are many standards or scales to evaluate, but there are fewer to discuss how to assess pleasurability. What's pleasurability? People are aware of the importance of living quality both materially and spiritually, `Happiness' also rises as a goal that people are pursuing nowadays. Therefore, the research focus of HCI has gradually shifted from usability to a more human-centered focus which involves pleasurability of emotion feedback. It's also called emotional design. User's needs usually increase from functionality, usability to pleasurability. To distinguish the variables of pros and cons of human-computer interaction(HCI), it involves different levels of inter-discussion. According to some literatures, `pleasurability' is part of `happiness', therefore, this paper concludes happyability is a collection of people's positive emotion which is provided by products, including four categories: satisfaction, emotion, engagement and social connection. The developing model of happyability will provide reference for HCI design.

Title: Optimum thought translation using intelligent BCI

Abstract: The field of brain computer interfaces has been emerged as a new way to simplify the lives of paralyzed, `Locked-in' people and people with motor disabilities. Modern brain computer interfaces provide an alternative to the natural neuronal pathways that are normally used to convey the brain signals/commands to different body parts. Brain computer interfaces use the captured brain signals to automate a particular user action. Before actually using the BCI, a subject needs to be trained accordingly. Training, though beneficial for system usage, appears quite tedious for the paralyzed/Locked-in subjects. Also, as the number of activities that can be automated using BCI increases, the amount of training that needs to be given also increases. Motivated by this fact, we propose a new intelligent BCI system, which require minimum amount of training, to be given to the subject. The proposed system uses P300 brainwaves for subject thought translation. The paper gives a brief study of these P300 waves. Finally, we discuss different factors involved in implementation of such system.

Title: Cognitive science perspective of human performance in built environments

Abstract: Built environments are design of spaces for individual, group of individuals and groups of individuals' i.e. from private spaces to public spaces to perform respective activities efficiently and productively. Human performances range from routine and non-routine types of activities in day-today life. The routine activities are rest, major work (profession) and navigation which are essential in everyday activities. The non-routine activities on daily, weekly, monthly or yearly bases relate to, and which support the activities that are essential ones. Built environments ought to provide a range of comfort factors to perform these activities, failure of which would lead to discomfort and thereby affects health and wellbeing of the humans. The concepts and methodologies in Cognitive Science are becoming essential in design of built environments to improve performance of various activities to maintain good health and wellbeing of the people. This paper reviews the importance of cognitive science perspective in human performance in built environments and there by pave its significance as a special topic. In summary, we propose that the cognitive neuroscience concepts and methods could be a viable methodology for understanding the problems related to the built environments as well as how they need to be designed to make the human performance better.

Title: Image CAPTCHA: Based on human understanding of real world distances

Abstract: We propose a Completely Automated Public Turing Test to Tell Computers and Humans Apart scheme based on a human's understanding of real world objects and their relative distances. Solving this CAPTCHA involves answering about the relative distances of objects present in an image. What is subtle to humans may not be so to computing machines. As an object moves farther away from the point of perception, its size decreases. But equipped with only the information on size, a decision cannot be made on its position from the point of perception. The real world knowledge on the object dimensions is essential since both a big and small object near the perception point will appear big and cannot be differentiated. This ability of humans, aided with experience, is a unique feature and would thus serve to distinguish them from computers. The queries on the CAPTCHA may include - "who stands behind whom", "which is nearer" or "which is larger in real life".

Title: Automatic detection of English words in Benglish text: A statistical approach

Abstract: Code-mixing and code-switching create challenges in the field of natural language processing applications like Machine Translation and Speech-to-Speech Translation. Detection of foreign words is very much essential for smooth processing of natural language. A statistical language independent approach for automatic detection of foreign words in mixed language has been introduced in this paper. Initially, the proposed approach has been applied on Benglish text which is combination of Bangla text contains English words. The methodology can be easily adopted for other languages where such code mixing exists. The proposed approach yields an accuracy of 71.82% when tested on sentences collected from Bangla blogs and social networking websites.

Title: Multichannel fused EMG based biofeedback system with virtual reality for gait rehabilitation

Abstract: Aim of this paper is to develop an EMG based biofeedback system using a virtual reality platform which will help in gait rehabilitation. A low power multichannel EMG acquisition unit has been developed to acquire EMG of six different muscles of the lower limb. EMG from different channels are fused using Bayesian fusion technique and spurious data has been discarded. From the fused EMG data, we calculate different gait parameters like stride time, gait phase etc. Joint trajectory during a gait cycle is obtained, digitized and combined with the gait parameters acquired from EMG. Together they are fed to a VR human model. Just like a person walks, the same EMG and trajectory data being fed to the model, it walks too mimicking the gait of the user, with the same speed, thus providing biofeedback to the user. The system has massive application in gait rehabilitation for post-stroke patients, people suffering from cerebral palsy and other neuro muscular gait defects, amputees etc.

Title: Noise suppression using Wiener filtering in the nonsubsampled contourlet domain for Magnetic Resonance brain images

Abstract: The Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is becoming famous in medical imaging because of its diagnostic applications in the medical analysis and benefits over other medical diagnostic methods. However, it is observed that the diagnosis operations is becoming difficult when the noise gets introduced in MR brain images as noise is the significant factor which influences the quality of diagnosis and treatment process of brain tumors and hence noise minimization is of significant concern. The predominant noise in MRI is Rician noise, which is the signal dependent noise while in this paper the Rician noise minimization is attained by combining the Wiener filter and Non Subsampled Contourlet Transform(NSCT), which conserves excellent characteristics of the MR brain image. For measuring the performance of proposed method, the Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), Coefficient of Correlation (CoC) and Quality Index (QI) are utilized in comparison with denoising by Wiener filter in Wavelet domain and Contourlet domain. It is evaluated that the proposed method has provided good results in the chosen evaluation metrics.

Title: A real time algorithm for detection of spectacles leading to eye detection

Abstract: Eye detection plays an important role in many Intelligent Human Computer Interaction (IHCI) applications such as eye tracking, eye gaze tracking, drowsiness monitoring etc. However the presence of spectacles makes the eye detection task difficult because of the glint produced by the lens. Earlier approaches on detection of eyes occluded with spectacles have been reported in literature, however with limited accuracies. This paper proposes a real-time algorithm for detection of spectacles leading to the detection of eyes. A video database of human subjects with and without spectacles has been created to evaluate the performance of the algorithm.

Title: An efficient algorithm for automatic fusion of RISAT-1 SAR data and Resourcesat-2 optical images

Abstract: Satellite Image fusion generates single hybrid image from a collection of input satellite images and helps us to extract maximum information from the remotely sensed datasets to achieve optimal spatial and spectral resolution. The critical steps of image fusion framework are co-registration of Synthetic Aperture Radar(SAR) data with corresponding optical scene, enhance the images for visual clarity and then merge the multi sensor data with a standard fusion technique. The image fusion system should perform all these steps in an automatic manner for providing ease to the user. The primary attention of this work is to examine the improvement that can be obtained by fusion of low resolution multi spectral data obtained from optical Resourcesat-2 platform (LISS-4MX/LISS-III/AWIFS Sensor having 5m/24m/56m spatial resolution) with high resolution RISAT-1 (Fine Resolution STRIPMAP (FRS-1)/Medium Resolution SCANSAR(MRS) mode data having 3m/18m spatial resolution) using SAR-Optical image fusion system discussed above. This integration of optical and SAR images from Indian Remote Sensing satellites facilitates better visual and automatic image interpretation. The Maximum Likelihood algorithm is used for classification of fused image and Resourcesat-2 multispectral data. The quality improvement of the fused product can be observed by comparing the classification accuracies of merged data with original multispectral data of the same region.

Title: An approach for ECG based cardiac abnormality detection through the scope of Cross Wavelet Transform

Abstract: The analysis of standard clinical electrocardiogram signal is one of the basic routine tests for preliminary screening of cardiac abnormalities. This work deals with classification of normal and IMI (Inferior Myocardial Infaction) and presents a method for analysis of ECG patterns using Cross Wavelet Transform (XWT). The cross-correlation between two time domain signals gives the measure of similarity between two waveforms. The application of the Continuous Wavelet Transform to two time series and the cross examination of the two decomposition reveals localized similarities in time and scale. A pathologically varying pattern in QT zone of inferior lead III, shows the presence of Inferior Myocardial Infarction (IMI). Application of Cross Wavelet Transform to a pair of data gives wavelet cross spectrum and wavelet coherence. A normal beat template is selected as the absolute normal ECG pattern and the coherence between various other normal and abnormal subjects is computed. The Wavelet cross spectrum and Wavelet coherence of various ECG patterns show distinguishing characteristics over two specific regions R1 and R2, where R1 is the QRS complex area and R2 is the T wave region. PTB diagnostic ECG database is used for evaluation of the methods. A heuristically determined mathematical formula extracts parameter(s) from the wavelet cross spectrum and coherence. Empirical tests establish that the parameter is relevant for classification of normal and abnormal Cardiac patterns. The classification accuracy is obtained as 92.5% respectively.

Title: Recognition of Indian Sign Language using feature fusion

Abstract: Sign Language is the most natural and expressive way for the hearing impaired. This paper presents a method for automatic recognition of two handed signs of Indian Sign Language (ISL). The method consists of three phases: Segmentation, Feature Extraction and Recognition. The segmentation is done through Otsu's algorithm. In the feature extraction phase, shape descriptors, HOG descriptors (Histogram of Oriented Gradient) and SIFT (Scale Invariant Feature Transform) feature have been fused to compute a feature vector. In the recognition phase, a multi-class Support Vector Machine (MSVM) is used for training and classifying signs of ISL. The experimental results provide evidence of the effectiveness of the proposed approach with 93% recognition rate.

Title: A perceptually motivated stationary wavelet packet filter-bank utilizing improved spectral over-subtraction algorithm for enhancing speech in non-stationary environments

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel speech enhancement approach for a single-microphone system to meet the demand of quality noise reduction algorithms. The proposed system incorporates a perceptually motivated stationary wavelet packet filter-bank (PM-SWPFB) and improved spectral over-subtraction (I-SOS) algorithm together to enhance the speech degraded by non-stationary or colored noise environment. The PM-SWPFB is obtained by adjusting the uniformly spaced stationary wavelet packet tree in order to most closely mimic the critical-bands of the psycho-acoustic model. The PM-SWPFB is, firstly, used to decompose the input noisy speech signal into nonuniform sub-bands. Then, I-SOS algorithm is used to estimate of speech from each sub-band. The I-SOS algorithm uses a new noise estimation approach, to estimate noise power from each sub-band without the need of explicit speech silence detection. The sub-band noise estimate is updated by adaptively smoothing the noisy signal power. The smoothing parameter is controlled by a function of the estimated signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The performance of the proposed speech enhancement system is evaluated objectively by SNR, Itakura-Saito distortion measure and subjectively by informal listening test. The results confirm that the proposed speech enhancement system is capable of reducing noise with little speech degradation remains acceptable in real-world environments, and the overall performance is superior to several competitive methods.

Title: Significance of learner dependent features for improving text readability using extractive summarization

Abstract: Information and Communication Technologies play major role in all types of day to day life activities including Government, public and social domains. The need for HCI aspects to be taken care in these activities has become a predominant one. Especially, incorporating HCI features in the academic environment is getting more attention. In the case of reading materials associated with any type of academic process or content delivery, much focus is to be given so that even people with learning difficulties can get the information to his/her level of ability. Though lot of information is available in the academic scenario in the forms of text books, course ware, on line resources, web documents etc., not all content is readable by all. Tools and technologies must be made available to help people with learning difficulties including dyslexics. The idea is to reduce the burden levels of the learners with the help of assistive technologies. In this direction, this paper focuses on highlighting the importance of various features to be considered for making the text readable by all, using summarization techniques. Text summarization based on both document level and learner level features are discussed for making the content readable for people with learning difficulties. The experiments show that learner dependent features improve the readability of the text through summary as preview of the text.

Title: Automatic recognition of major language families in India

Abstract: India is a vast country with a large number of languages. Among these some languages descend from a single mother language giving rise to a language family. The major official languages in India fall under two language families namely Indo-European and Dravidian. In this paper, we have discussed about a system which takes speech file as input and identifies the language family to which it belongs. We also used this system to find out the influence of Dravidian family on Indo-European family. The system uses a combination of Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and Shifted Delta Coefficients (SDC) as language specific features. Presently, SDC is the most popular feature for language identification. It captures temporal information of speech over a broad range of time. Gaussian Mixture Model based approach is used to effectively model the language families where the distribution of feature vector of a class is approximated using sum of Gaussians. The results give interesting insights of certain Indian languages and applicability of machine learning process in this domain.

Title: A novel game theoretic algorithm for project selection under fuzziness

Abstract: Software project success or failure depends on the ineffective software project management. Success or failure of any project can be attributed incorrect handling of one or more project variables: people, proper technology, proper project scheduling and selection. Among these attributes proper project selection is one of the most vital part of software project management. There exist many uncertainties in project management and current software engineering techniques are unable to eliminate them. So there is huge scope for developing. The current researchers have developed a unique model which is capable to take decision on the field of software project selection. This model has two embedded sub models namely fuzzy AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) and strategic game model. Here in the first case experts opinions are considered under fuzzy environment and in the second case, different decisions makers act as players in the game module. Different criteria are taken into consideration for choosing optimal strategy of the players. An elaborated case study is also analyzed for testing the output of the system.

Title: Combining Words and Pictures for Museum Information Retrieval

Abstract: In this paper we propose the use of multilevel classification techniques similar to concept of Bayesian belief networks for Combining Words and Pictures (Images) for Museum Information Retrieval. We have designed our own corpus on Allahabad Museum. This approach is static which allows one to compute the rank of documents of relevant words and pictures with respect to some query and a given corpus. In our case, we view combining words and pictures as a task in which a training dataset of tagged pictures is provided and we need to automatically combine the query relevant words and pictures. To do this, we first describe the picture using feature vector. We do static analysis over computed features to get distinguishing feature descriptors. Maximum similarity i.e. minimum distance allows us to find the query relevant combined pictures and associated relevant words. For textual part of the query we compute the concepts (keywords as well as synonyms of each keyword in the query and their categories). Using the concept of image hierarchy, we calculate the score of each labeled document and select top five documents with its associated pictures.

Title: Semantic based orthographic with prepositional phrase for English-Tamil translation

Abstract: Machine translation quality has improved substantially in recent years. Many researchers have contributed and developed quite good algorithms, frameworks and models for various languages. Processing of natural language involves various levels, complexities, ambiguities arise at each of those levels. Some pragmatic and semantic approaches can be used to tackle these issues. Generally, prepositions are plays sound role in meaningful translation for any languages. While translating from English to Tamil, preposition in English sentences should be translated to postposition to have meaningful sentences. Thus the prepositional phase errors and orthographic errors are the major issue in machine translation. The main goal of this paper is to improve the translation quality. To achieve the goal, we use some semantic rule to correct the prepositional and orthographic errors in this English-Tamil translation. The proposed approach takes as input an English sentence containing a preposition and the correct postposition and correct spelling in Tamil for that particular sentence context as output. The rules are evaluated with corpus data and the performance is good. The outcomes of the results are compared with Google Translate.

Title: CONVEX: Conjunct Verb extraction from parallel corpus: A hybrid approach

Abstract: Conjunct Verbs (CVs) are one of the special forms of Complex Predicates that behave as a single verbal unit but maintain a multiword structure. CVs play an important role in Natural Language Processing applications like Speech to Speech Translation, Machine Translation and lexical resource creation. But due to their distinct construction, detection and extraction of CVs is a challenging task. This paper presents a hybrid approach for mining CVs from parallel corpus combining rule-based and statistical approach. Though the proposed approach has been applied on Bangla-English parallel corpus to extract Bangla CVs, the methodology is equally applicable to other Indian languages of Indo-Aryan family, in presence of parts of speech tagger and sufficient amount of parallel corpus. Evaluation on Bangla-English parallel corpus of 50,000 sentences, the proposed approach yields an accuracy of 76% that can be improved by increasing the number of sentence pairs in the parallel corpus.

Title: “Effective learning through e-learning system: DEA Approach”: HCI technologies for education

Abstract: The paper investigates the relative efficiency of visual and phonetic features of e-learning system for student's learning effectiveness leading to better academic achievement and employability. The e-learning system is a form of human computer interaction process build and transferable skills through computer. The features used in e-learning system to sustain student's long span of focus attention result in retention of information in long-term memory, which can be utilized later for problem solving and situation. After experimentation of e-learning system along with traditional classroom teaching, the data collected are analyzed through DEA Approach. The findings indicate improvement in academic scoring and employability skills after e-learning system implementation because of on-hand exposure, any time discussion form and open resources. Thus visual and phonetic features applied for study can be utilized by others for better e-learning interface designing.

Title: Motor imagery based BCI for a maze game

Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals generated out of motor imagery (MI) can be used for Brain Computer Interfacing (BCI). In order to accomplish this goal, we have classified four different MI tasks using two hybrid features of bispectrum of EEG through a RBF kernel support vector machine. As a demonstration of its applicability for a non-invasive BCI, we design and develop a BCI maze game, where a player plays the game in real time using his brain signals.

Title: Rule based human activity recognition for surveillance system

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for classification and recognition of human activities in complex motion. We propose a template matching based method to classify the objects and a rule-based approach to recognize human activities. First, moving objects are detected and their silhouettes are generated in each frame. Second, template matching based approach is used to classify the generated silhouette and then a rule based classifier is applied to classify human activities such as running, walking, bending, boxing and jogging etc. The experimental results show that the system can recognize seven types of primitive actions with high accuracy.

Title: A temporal constraint based planning approach for city tour and travel plan generation

Abstract: In this paper, we present an AI planning-based city tour and travel application. The system assists the travellers to generate temporally constrained plans and their interactive map-based visualizations. We discuss the requirement of temporal constraints in the domain of city tour and travel application and consequent modelling of such an application as a temporally constrained planning problem. We have proposed schemes for specification and processing of temporal constraints in a Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planner. We have redefined the basic PDDL3.0 temporal operators by imposing interval bounds and defined them as a restricted subset of Metric Interval Temporal Logic (MITL) family. The planner has been used to devise city tour and travel plans under temporal constraints and the generated plans have been rendered through Google-map based navigation interface.

Title: Forward and inverse kinematics of a robotic frog

Abstract: Among all the kinds of locomotion adapted by the living organisms in nature, jumping has proven itself as one of the most efficient ways of traversal through rough terrain. Frogs are the efficient and stable organisms which use jumping as their primary means of locomotion. For any legged robot to take a perfect jump, taking off perfectly is one of the most important aspects. So, the trajectory of the center of gravity (CG) of the robot is of the utmost importance. For this, the motion and coordination of the legs should be very precise for which, we have to carry out the forward and inverse kinematics of the robot. In this paper, we used Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) Parameters to carry out the forward kinematics. Jacobian and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) methods are used to compute the inverse kinematics of the robot and a comparison of performance of these two methods is presented.

Title: An auditory perception based improved multi-band spectral subtraction algorithm for enhancement of speech degraded by non-stationary noises

Abstract: In this paper, an auditory perception based improved multi-band spectral subtraction algorithm is proposed to enhance the speech signal degraded by non-stationary or colored noises. In the proposed scheme, the whole speech spectrum is divided in different non-uniform bands (N = 6) in accordance to the critical-band rate scale and spectral subtraction is applied separately in each band. The proposed algorithm uses a new approach to estimate the noise power from each band without the need of explicit speech silence detection. The noise estimate is updated by adaptively smoothing the noisy signal power. The smoothing parameter is controlled by a linear function of a-posteriori signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This noise estimation approach gives accurate results at low SNR and works continuously in the presence of speech. The objective measures as well as informal subjective tests demonstrate that the proposed algorithm reduces remnant noise efficiently and the enhanced speech contains minimal speech distortions with improved SNR.

Title: Speaker identification from film dialogues

Abstract: A considerable research on speaker identification from speech dialogues has been conducted. However, the present article reports speaker identification task from film dialogue which includes textual features only. We have used a text corpus of film scripts, extracted from the IMSDb archive and annotated with speakers. As different characters in a script exhibit various linguistic styles while speaking, we have incorporated the stylistic features that are extracted from the turns of various characters. These features include frequency based information commonly used in author identification task as well as the part-of-speech (POS) information of turn text. The k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), Naïve Bayes' (NB) and Conditional Random Field (CRF) classifiers have been employed for identifying the speakers from the dialogue scripts at turn levels. All the supervised classifiers outperform the baseline system that was developed using a simple randomization technique.

Title: Better human computer interaction by enhancing the quality of text-to-speech synthesis

Abstract: In this paper we propose high quality prosody models for enhancing the quality of text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis for providing better human computer interaction. In this study prosody refers to duration and intonation patterns of the sequence of syllables. In this work, prosody models are developed using feedforward neural networks, and prosodic information is predicted from linguistic and production constraints of syllables. The prediction accuracy of the proposed neural network based prosody models is compared objectively with Classification and Regression Tree based prosody models used by Festival. Subjective listening tests are also performed to evaluate the quality of the synthesized speech generated by incorporating the predicted prosodic features. From the evaluation studies, it is observed that prediction accuracy is better for neural network models, compared to other models.

Title: Intertwining cognitive and affective intelligence into digital artifacts: An infrastructural approach

Abstract: Designing and developing digital technological systems and their interactive interfaces as better companion with hominine characteristics is an active research hot-spot. Exploring the domain of facilitating machines with affective and cognitive intelligence and understanding the users is increasingly attracting the interest of researchers who are working in the field of human-computer interaction. If the interactive interfaces of digital system are enriched with human-like characteristics and such systems have an understanding of user's affective state (personality, mood and emotions) along with the ability to respond accordingly during interaction then definitely these intelligent hominine interfaces will be more natural, enjoyable, friendly and believable. The key challenge is to determine most appropriate techniques and models for generating these futuristic harmonious intelligent affective interfaces and services which may be quite different from their present GUI counterparts. This paper presents an infrastructural approach for machines to first realize the user's affective space and then creating its own cognitive and affective space to respond appropriately and harmoniously to the user. The proposed work suggests the methods and models to identify/determine user's personality (through AN-ECHO model), emotions (through facial expression recognition method) and mood (through computational model). The proposed approach uses personality along with user-profiling method to understand user's interests, preferences, characteristics, expectations etc. in order to incorporate cognitive intelligence. In this way, the proposed approach facilitates the machine to assess personality, mood and emotions of the user to express personalized and adaptive behavior to the user.

Title: Evaluation of feature extraction techniques in emotional state recognition

Abstract: We present in this paper a study of three EEG signals feature extraction techniques. These techniques have been widely employed in researches of emotional states recognition: statistical characteristics, features based on PSD (Power Spectral Density) and features based on HOC (High Order Crossings). The validation was performed via classification of emotional states of calm and stress using the K-NN based classifier in off-line mode using EEG signals from available DEAP database. The best results achieved were 70.1%, using the PSD based technique, and 69.59% using the HOC based technique.

Title: A Persuasive game for social development of children in Indian cultural context — A Human Computer Interaction design approach

Abstract: In this paper, we present a Human centered Human Computer Interaction design approach for conceptualization of Persuasive games relevant to Indian cultural context. Core of the protocol process adopted involved semi-structured interviews with nineteen Indian families, where parents have reported certain behaviors, which they wished to change in their children in a positive way. On qualitative evaluation of parents' responses using Fogg's behavior model as the basis, it was found that “diffidence” or “shyness” is one such behavior that demands most from the children in order to bring a positive change using the medium of digital games. The game units such as characters, objects, and environment were derived from the analysis of field notes of the semi-structured interviews. We have used a method analogue to “Grow-A-Game” technique to generate the game concept. Ultimately, we present a final persuasive game concept which is intended to bring about positive changes in children' diffidence and shyness behaviors.

Title: ZOR SE BOLO: Interactive installations for Airport, providing a linguistic tour of New Delhi

Abstract: Today, New Delhi with more than 10,000 people speaking an estimate of 122 languages [1], has led it to enter into a new kind of multilingual anarchy. The conversational language has disintegrated into an array of jargons, idioms, acronyms, abbreviations, and symbols. ZOR SE BOLO presents 5 of the most commonly spoken jargons of the capital, (“Thoda adjust karlo”, “Bhai kuch jugaad laga”, “Tu jaanta hai mera baap kaun hai?”, “Tum toh bade log ho”, “No Problem ji”), in the form of interactive installations to be displayed at the Delhi International Airport (T3 Terminal) with a view of providing a linguistic tour of the capital. Two of the design concepts (“No Problem ji” and “Tu jaanta hai mera baap kaun hai?”) were successfully prototyped and exhibited. The concept was achieved in 3 main phases: literature research & analysis, design and implementation. “Touch” and “Speech” were used as interaction mediums to design an experience such that people relate to the individuals and their lingo through the audio they hear after triggering the installation. Body language / gestures of the mannequins in the installations becomes a metaphor to reach out and establish contact between people of different tongues, from different cultures.

Title: A comparative study of native (L1) and Nonnative (L2) English speech strategy for discourse prosodic organization

Abstract: English speech of L1 English and L1 Bengali speakers of the same discourse is analyzed by applying hierarchical discourse prosody framework HPG (Hierarchy of Prosodic Phrase Group) in order to find the between-and within-group similarities and differences in speech planning of L1 (native) and L2 (non-native) English speakers for prosodic organization at discourse level. The analysis reveals that the speech rate of L1 speakers is higher than speech rate of L2 speakers; L2 speakers contain more break boundary than that of the L1 speakers at every discourse prosodic level in the organization, which exhibit the fact that L2 speakers use more intermediate chunking units and larger scale planning units than that of L1 speakers. Between-group differences are also found through the analysis of phrase component at prosodic phrase level (PPh) and accent component at prosodic word level (PW). These findings can be attributed to L2 speakers' improper phrasing, improper word level prominence and ambiguous difference between content words and function words in discourse prosodic organization.

Title: Kernel Induced Rough c-means clustering for lymphocyte image segmentation

Abstract: Blood microscopic image segmentation is a fundamental tool for automated diagnosis of hematological disorders. In particular, lymphoblast image segmentation acts as the foundation for all image based leukemia diagnostic system. Precision in image segmentation is a necessary condition for improving the diagnostic accuracy in automated cytology. Since the diagnostic information content of the segmented images are plentiful, suitable segmentation routines need to be developed for better disease recognition. In this paper, Kernel Induced Rough C-means (KIRCM) clustering algorithm is introduced for the segmentation of human lymphocyte images. Rough C-means clustering (RCM) is performed in higher dimensional feature space to obtain improved segmentation accuracy and to facilitate automated Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) detection. Comparative analysis reveals that use of rough sets in kernel space clustering for leukocyte segmentation gives the proposed scheme an edge over existing schemes.

Title: A semi-supervised change detection for remotely sensed images using ensemble classifier

Abstract: In the present work, a change detection technique in remotely sensed images (under the scarcity of labeled patterns) is proposed where an ensemble of semi-supervised classifiers is used, instead of using a single (weak) classifier. Iterative learning of multiple classifier system is carried out using the selected unlabeled patterns along with a few labeled patterns. Selection of unlabeled patterns for the next training step is done using ensemble agreement. Finally, the unlabeled patterns are assigned to a class by fusing the outcome of base classifiers using a combiner. For the present investigation, multilayer perceptron (MLP), elliptical basis function neural network (EBFNN) and fuzzy k-nearest neighbor (KNN) techniques are used as base classifiers. Experiments are carried out on multi-temporal and multi-spectral images and the results for the proposed methodology are found to be encouraging.

Title: Classification of web pages on attractiveness: A supervised learning approach

Abstract: Random surfers spend very little time on a web page. If the most important web page content fails to attract his attention within the short time span, he will move away to some other page, thus defeating the purpose of the web page designer. In order to predict if the contents of a web page will catch a random surfer's attention or not, we propose a machine learning based approach to classify web pages into “bad” and “not bad” classes, where the “bad” class implies poor attention drawing ability. We propose to divide web page contents into “objects”, which are coherent regions of web page conveying the same information, to develop the classifier approach. We surveyed 100 web pages sampled from the Internet to identify the type and frequency of objects used in web page design. From our survey, we identified six types of objects that are most important in determining the class of a web page, in terms of its attention drawing capability. We used the WEKA tool to implement the machine learning approach. Two different strategies of percentage split and three different strategies of cross validation are used to check for accuracy of the classifier. We have experimented with 65 algorithms supported by WEKA and found that the algorithms RBF network and Random subspace, among the 65, gives the best performance, with about 83% accuracy.

Title: Measurement of PERCLOS using eigen-eyes

Abstract: Monitoring of the level vigilance in humans through human computer interaction has been a field of interest for image processing researchers for long time. Numerous activities carried out by humans require constant vigil over a period of time. A lack of alertness can lead to precious human life and/or economic losses. A major cause of reduced level of vigilance is drowsiness. This paper presents a method based on Principle Component Analysis to classify eyes and calculate PERcentage eye CLOSure (PERCLOS) for drowsiness detection. PERCLOS is an established parameter to detect the level of drowsiness. Using Singular Value Decomposition eigen-eye spaces are created for fully open, partially open and fully closed eyes in the training phase from eye images. These eigen spaces are used to categorize test eye images to one of these three categories for calculating PERCLOS. Experimental results show nearly 98% accuracy for offline as well as for online categorization of eyes for calculating PERCLOS and level of drowsiness.

Title: A video database of human faces under near Infra-Red illumination for human computer interaction applications

Abstract: Human Computer Interaction (HCI) is an evolving area of research for coherent communication between computers and human beings. Some of the important applications of HCI as reported in literature are face detection, face pose estimation, face tracking and eye gaze estimation. Development of algorithms for these applications is an active field of research. However, availability of standard database to validate such algorithms is insufficient. This paper discusses the creation of such a database created under Near Infra-Red (NIR) illumination. NIR illumination has gained its popularity for night mode applications since prolonged exposure to Infra-Red (IR) lighting may lead to many health issues. The database contains NIR videos of 60 subjects in different head orientations and with different facial expressions, facial occlusions and illumination variation. This new database can be a very valuable resource for development and evaluation of algorithms on face detection, eye detection, head tracking, eye gaze tracking etc. in NIR lighting.

Title: Handwritten text documents binarization and skew normalization approaches

Abstract: Handwritten text recognition has been an active research area for many years. Handwritten text recognition needs to perform some preprocessing steps for better recognition. First, we find binary image of given handwritten text document and then after performing the line segmentation task, we normalize it to the segmented lines. There are various normalization tasks such as skew normalization, slant normalization and size normalization. This paper, focuses on the handwritten document binarization and skew normalization and proposes a novel global binarization approach, which is very cost effective. We also propose a new skew normalization approach which is based on orthogonal projection of the segmented line with respect to x-axis. The method has been experimented on various styles of handwritten text documents, and it is found that it detects the exact skew angle, and corrects it efficiently. A comparative study has also been reported to provide a detailed analysis of the proposed methods together with some other existing methods in the literature.

Title: Construction of intuitionistic fuzzy contrast enhanced medical images

Abstract: Medical images are poorly illuminated and enhancement is very much essential. Though there are many image enhancement algorithms in literature, but enhancement of medical images is very much difficult. This paper presents a new method using intuitionistic fuzzy set theory for medical image enhancement. The method produces an intuitionistic fuzzy image using Sugeno type fuzzy complement and the parameter in intuitionistic fuzzy image is optimized using intuitionistic fuzzy entropy. Experimental results on several low contrasted medical images show that the proposed method produces better enhanced image as compared to the existing fuzzy and intuitionistic fuzzy methods.

Title: Video & EOG based investigation of pure saccades in human subjects

Abstract: Human Computer Interaction (HCI) is the methodology through which computing systems understand actions of human beings. Some important applications of HCI as reported in literature are eye gaze estimation, eye tracking, alertness and health monitoring etc. Of them major applications are based upon eye movements. However, accurate estimation of these measurements is still a challenge in research community. A particular type of eye movement i.e. saccadic eye movement has potential applications in HCI such as alertness assessment, disease diagnosis etc. Electrooculography (EOG) based measurement of saccadic movements has been reported to be an accurate method. However being a contact based method, alternative method as suggested by literature is image based approach. This paper aims to investigate the correlation between video and EOG based observation of pure horizontal directional saccades to establish a relationship between image and EOG signals.

Title: A step towards an intelligent Human Computer Interaction: Physiology-based affect-recognizer

Abstract: Impairment in social communication skills is one of the core deficits in the children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). These children are characterized by an inherent inability to express their affective states thereby imposing limitations on traditional self-report and observational methodologies. However physiological signals are continuously available and are arguably not impacted by these difficulties. In recent years several assistive technologies utilizing the benefits of physiology-based systems have been investigated to promote social communication skills in this population. Among these we chose Virtual Reality (VR) as our platform. Investigations in the area of Human Computer Interaction (HCI) have shown that variations in the physiological signals can be evoked by different amounts of presence in the VR environment and the transition from one affective state to another is accompanied by dynamic shift in indicators of Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) activity. The presented work seeks to fuse behavioral viewing pattern and peripheral physiological features with the affective rating. Thus, this is a step towards indicating the potential of such a system to build an intelligent therapist-like affect-recognizer. The preliminary findings of a usability study are promising.

Title: High-speed noninvasive brain-computer interfaces

Abstract: Brain computer interface (BCI) systems allow interaction with machines through a channel that does not involve the traditional motor pathways of the human nervous system. Thus they can be used by people with severe motor disabilities or those whose limbs are occupied with other tasks. In BCI systems that recently showed greatest interest of researchers, electrical brain activity is measured on the scalp, thus basically they are noninvasive. Using the EEG measurements as the input to the BCI offers the advantages of low cost and high time resolution. However, due to small amplitude of the signal components, relatively high power of noise and poor spatial resolution, achieving large speed, accuracy and the number of targets is a challenge. At present, the steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) BCI paradigm is believed to provide the most promising way of optimizing the BCI performance in that sense. A review of the SSVEP BCI projects is presented, including studies of biodiversity of human EEG response to visual excitation, as well as the design of techniques for visual stimulation, EEG signal acquisition and analysis for best BCI performance. The review is based both on the literature and results of own teamwork.

Title: When are pictures processed on a webpage?

Abstract: Several cognitive models like CoLiDeS and CoLiDeS + Pic are developed to simulate Web navigation. CoLiDeS + Pic assumes that information provided by pictures on a Web page is processed at the beginning of processing a page. In the current experiment we verified this assumption by using eye-fixation data of participants. We varied the pictures based on their relevancy (low or high relevant to the content of a page) and position (left or right). We also manipulated the user's goal by giving specific tasks to one group and asking another group to simply browse the Web site. We performed mixed ANOVAs on the eye-fixation data. Our results show that pictures were processed particularly during the initial 10% of the total time spent on a webpage. Also left-positioned and high-relevant pictures were processed relatively longer at early intervals. However no difference was found between the task-oriented and simple-browse groups.

Title: Multimodal human-computer interfaces based on advanced video and audio analysis

Abstract: Multimodal interfaces development history is reviewed briefly in the introduction. Examples of applications of multimodal interfaces to education software and for the disabled people are presented, including interactive electronic whiteboard based on video image analysis, application for controlling computers with mouth gestures and the audio interface for speech stretching for hearing impaired and stuttering people. The Smart Pen providing a tool for supporting therapy of developmental dyslexia is presented and results achieved with its application are discussed. The eye-gaze tracking system named “Cyber-Eye” developed at the Multimedia Systems Department employed to many kinds of experiments is presented including analysis of visual activity of patients remaining in vegetative state and their awareness evaluation. The scent emitting multimodal computer interface provides an important supplement of the polysensoric stimulation process, playing an essential role in education and therapy of children with certain developmental disorders. A new approach to diagnosing Parkinson's disease is shown. The progression of the disease can be measured employing the UPDRS (Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale) scale which is used to evaluate motor and behavioral symptoms of Parkinson's disease, based on the multimodal interface called Virtual-Touchpad (VTP) used for supporting medical diagnosis. The paper is concluded with some general remarks concerning the role of multimodal computer interfaces applied to learning, therapy and everyday usage of computerized devices.

Title: Automatic people density maps generation with use of movement detection analysis

Abstract: The paper presents technical aspects related to the video computer analysis of people movement in the sales rooms. Automatic generation of the people density maps (also referred to as the “heat maps”) is helpful for the analysis of customers' and employees' behavior in sale and office rooms advertising effectiveness research or tracking movements. Generation of the density maps was realized with the video recordings acquired by typical video surveillance cameras. Data processing was done off-line but the achieved processing time allows the real-time implementation. Experimental tests were carried out at several points of the customer services.

Title: Human pose fusion for scalable kinetic interfaces

Abstract: In this paper we present a method for fusion of human poses that are estimated simultaneously from multiple RGB-D cameras. The proposed solution is scalable in terms of the number of used sensors, processing power, network overhead and keeping latency within small temporal bounds. Spatial relations of cameras are continuously estimated in near real-time from the acquired data. Sensors can be added, removed or repositioned without significant disruption of the systems functioning.

Title: Intuitive approach to knowledge integration

Abstract: Integration of distributed knowledge is one of the crucial tasks in modern societies. This paper describes a framework for an integration of distributed knowledge. The integrated stance is further communicated using linguistic statements. Idealised approaches found in the literature largely tend to evaluate to a single centroid, and as such, provide unintuitive results, mostly in societies with low consistency. Proposed framework reflects a multi-stage character of intuitive knowledge integration. Individual stances are first reinterpreted to knowledge items defined over a common ground, universe. Further, items are collated to form consistent clusters of knowledge that characterise with high consistency and are suitable for the idealised approach. Finally, each identified cluster is assigned with a certain linguistic label and communicated using modal operators which allow to express an interplay between the strengths of different views in the society.

Title: Events for human-system interaction modeling with IOPT Petri nets

Abstract: In this paper, a set of event types for human-system interaction modeling is presented, and its usage with IOPT nets (Input-Output Place-Transition Petri nets) models is illustrated. Currently, a non-autonomous event based on the computation of the change with respect to a specific threshold of input signals values on two consecutive execution steps is defined for IOPT models. Other types of events are proposed, allowing the definition of an event not only based on a threshold in the signal value, but also as a change on the variation of the signal. The concept of delayed events considers two values in different time steps (other than consecutive steps). This concept can be applied to previous types of events. The concept of composed events is also introduced, in order to create events dependent on two or more events on the same signal, at the same time step as well as at different time steps. Finally, an example is used to illustrate the concepts presented.

Title: Movement perception with the use of a motorized delta armrest and virtual reality

Abstract: In this paper we present a combination of neuroscience experiments with the use of a parallel armrest robot to study the effects of temporal delays and spatial biases on the movement perception. A dedicated armrest to guide and manipulate the arm has been developed for these experiments. It is a three-degree-of-freedom Delta structure. In combination with a virtual reality application, the movement perception has been evaluated. The results of this study demonstrate that experimental conditions such as spatial deviations and temporal delays impair the correct self-attribution of the movements done with the motorized Delta armrest. This result shows that the motorized Delta armrest can be successfully used to study the effect of movement perception, opening up the way to new studies about the movement perception using robotic system and virtual reality.

Title: SEES: Concept and design of a smart environment explorer stick

Abstract: Visually Impaired Person or People (VIP) need to improve both orientation and mobility capabilities in order to be able to walk autonomously and safely using a white stick (cane). However, the feedback provided by an enhanced white stick (smart stick) does not integrate assistance to orientation and walking functions. This paper proposes to fill this gap and outlines the SEES (Smart Environment Explorer Stick) an enhanced white cane which assists the VIP's navigation. The active multi-sensor context-awareness concept is adopted to be implemented in the SEES to help the VIP to move safely and easily in any places (indoor or outdoor). The first prototype of SEES (hardware and software) is presented in this paper.

Title: Global interaction space for user interaction with a room of computers

Abstract: To interact with a computer, a user can walk up to it and interact with it through its local interaction space defined by its input devices. With multiple computers in a room, the user can walk up to each computer and interact with it. However, this can be logistically impractical and forces the user to learn each computers local interaction space. Interaction involving multiple computers also becomes hard or even impossible to do. We propose to have a global interaction space, letting users, through in-room gestures, select and issue commands to one or multiple computers in the room. A global interaction space has functionality to sense and record the state of a room, including location of computers, users, and gestures, and use this to issue commands to each computer. A prototype has been implemented in a room with multiple computers and a wall-sized large display. The global interaction space is used to issue commands, moving display output from on-demand selected computers to the large display and back again. It is also used to select multiple computers and concurrently execute commands on them.

Title: An automatic adjustable backrest for a posture coordination of a seated patient on a wheelchair

Abstract: For reducing a risk of pressure sore caused by long period sitting on a wheelchair, a patient is required to depressurize buttocks by changing the posture suitably. Thus, we have been developed an automatic depressurization motion assistance system for a seated patient on a wheelchair. In our previous work, we developed a sitting surface coordination system which can lift or incline and assists a depressurization motion of a patient. However, in some cases, it is difficult to change his posture suitably for patients who do not have enough physical strength in their upper body using our proposed device. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel posture coordination assistance system for a wheelchair user. Our system consists of the adjustable sitting surface and novel proposed adjustable backrest. These two devices coordinate the sitting posture of the patient automatically. Our key ideas are two topics. One topic is mechanical design of the adjustable backrest for practical use. We realize small mechanism which enables easy implementation to a general wheelchair without special reconstruction. The other topic is a natural posture coordination scheme using the sitting surface and the backrest. We analyze buttocks depressurization operation by a nursing specialist and drive our proposed devices for realizing it. The performance of our system is verified by experiments using our prototype.

Title: Human machine interaction via brain activity monitoring

Abstract: Brain Computer Interfaces (BC!) are becoming increasingly studied as methods for users to interact with computers because recent technological developments have lead to low priced, high precision BCI devices that are aimed at the mass market. This paper investigates the ability for using such a device in real world applications as well as limitations of such applications. The device tested in this paper is called the Emotiv EPOC headset, which is an electroencephalograph (EEG) measuring device and enables the measuring of brain activity using 14 strategically placed sensors. This paper presents: 1) a BCI framework driven completely by thought patterns, aimed at real world applications 2) a quantitative analysis of the performance of the implemented system. The Emotiv EPOC headset based BCI framework presented in this paper was tested on a problem of controlling a simple differential wheeled robot by identifying four thought patterns in the user: “neutral”, “move forward”, “turn left”, and “turn right”. The developed approach was tested on 6 individuals and the results show that while BCI control of a mobile robot is possible, precise movement required to guide a robot along a set path is difficult with the current setup. Furthermore, intense concentration is required from users to control the robot accurately.

Title: Usability driven model transformation

Abstract: Model Driven Engineering (MDE) is a software approach which promotes the use of models and model transformations as primary artifacts in the development process. Recently there has been wide interest in applying MDE approach in the Human Computer Interaction (HCI) field. It has been proved that MDE is an appropriate technique to generate as automatically as possible the final user interface from the conceptual model. Given a source model there may be several ways to transform it into target model. Alternative target models are equivalent from the functional perspective and may differ in their usability attributes. Driven the model transformation process by the usability properties is as yet unexplored territory. This study attempts to enter this territory by showing how the control of the selection of the alternative transformations based on the desired usability criteria can be an appealing way to ensure the usability of the generated artifact.

Title: Semantic relationships and approximations of sets: An ontological graph based approach

Abstract: Approximation of sets is a fundamental notion of rough set theory (RST) proposed by Z. Pawlak. In a classic approach, considered in RST, approximation of sets is defined on the basis of an indiscernibility relation between objects in some universe of discourse. However, approximations of sets become problematic in many cases, especially, if attribute values describing objects are symbolical (e.g., words, terms, linguistic concepts, etc.). In fact, such a situation is natural in human cognition and description of the real world. Different approaches perfecting rough set theory in this area have been proposed in the literature. One of them is based on incorporating ontologies enabling us to add some new, valuable knowledge which can be used in data analysis, rule generation, reasoning, etc. In the paper, we propose to use ontological graphs in determining approximations of sets and show how ontological graphs change a look at them. The presented approach refers to a general trend in computations proposed by L. Zadeh and called “computing with words”.

Title: Age differentiated usability evaluation of project management software

Abstract: Computer aided project management is a useful tool in project planning especially when dealing with large and complex project plans. Project planning is often accomplished by older employees due to their knowledge and experience. This paper describes a usability study in which three off-the-shelf software tools were investigated regarding execution times, fixation durations and user acceptance for two different age groups. As a result deficits in the de-facto standard are detected and implications for further research are derived.

Title: Usability evaluation of biometrics in mobile environments

Abstract: Actual trends in HCI tend to move systems to mobile environments. Moreover, biometrics is a technology that is entering maturity, getting involved in several security architectures nowadays. Thus, migrating biometrics to mobile scenarios is a trending topic in the research community. Nevertheless, in this kind of systems, usability has been put aside in the intent of produce better performance and it could involve undesirable results. In this work a behavioural biometric modality (handwritten signature recognition) is tested in mobile environments, in order to obtain a complete usability evaluation. Users signed in an iPad with different styluses in different scenarios, correlating performance results with several usability parameters (gathered through video, notes and forms) and obtaining interesting outcomes.

Title: Discrete Wavelet transform and ANFIS classifier for Brain-Machine Interface based on EEG

Abstract: In this paper, an on-line Brain-Machine Interface (BMI) based on Electroencephalography (EEG) that closes and opens a robotic hand when eyes are closed and open, respectively, is presented. This BMI is based on the measurement of the EEG bipolar connection: 01-P3. Moreover, since it is considered to be very important for some BMI biomedical applications a fast processing time and feature classification of the EEG signal, the authors propose a novel algorithm for on-line DWT processing of the EEG signal that, along with the feature classifier, have an average processing time (APT) of 37.9 ms. An Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) was used as the feature classifier obtaining an on-line average classification accuracy (ACA) of 96.0%; after an off-line ANFIS training. The average and the maximum value of the last two calculated level 4 detailed coefficients (cD
4
), derived from Wavelet's decomposition, were used as the inputs of the ANFIS classifier. The detailed coefficient cD
4
 was selected due to the fact that this coefficient isolates the EEG alpha wave(7.19~14.4 Hz), which presents significant changes on the bipolar connection O1-P3 whenever a subject closes and opens its eyes. The output of the ANFIS classifier is the input voltage of a microcontroller, which generates a Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM) signal that controls the movement of the robotic hand.

Title: Posture independent model for hand detection and tracking

Abstract: Human Computer Interaction takes the attention of many researches all over the world, researches try to invent more natural and intuitive interaction ways between humans and computers. However, people depend mainly on their hands to interact with surrounding objects in everyday life. In this paper we present a novel appearance based method to recognize and track human hand in an unknown environment without any constraints on hand posture and with no need to wear any additional devices. Our method can distinguish between hand and other moving objects, by using proposed posture independent hand features. Results show that our method can recognize and track human hand at real-time with 96% accuracy rate in normal indoors light.

Title: 3D human hand motion recognition system

Abstract: The results of design and investigation on a human gesture recognition system, based on a Kinect sensor, are presented in this paper. In the presented research, we use a Kinect device as a 3D data scanner. Therefore, the 3D coordinates are calculated directly from depth images. The system's hardware description and computation method for 3D human gesture identification are presented in this study. Ten specific single hand motion gestures, repeated several times by seven different people were recorded and used in the experimentation. Gesture recognition and interpretation are performed by using a trained neural classifier in two ways. In the first way, single hand motion gestures are captured in free 3D space, while in the second one people's heads coordinates in 3D are used as reference points for recorded hand gestures. Such an approach provided easy adaptation and flexibility for gesture interpretation. The structure of the classifier was estimated through the trial and error approach.

Title: The assistive walker using hand haptics — The design of the prototype

Abstract: The purpose of this research is to develop the sight assistive walker using hand haptics information. In order to realize user's active environmental recognition, the proposed system has passive actuators instead of active actuators. This system is something like a cane, and it has a small mobile platform on its tip. The small platform is equipped with some wheels and generates brake forces. And the generated force is transmitted to the user's hand through the grip attached to the walker. The system configurations are as follows. The Laser range finder is used for environmental sensing. The powder brakes are used for generating passive brake forces. In order to let the mobile platform move both lateral and back-forward, the four omni-directional wheels are adopted. By generating passive brake force based on the distance to the obstacles in the moving direction of the system, user can recognize the environment based on the hand haptics information. In addition, user has to walk by him/herself, therefore the user's intention is indispensable. In particular, this paper shows the design concept, system configuration and outline of the prototype.

Title: Developing risk models for complex systems

Abstract: Disasters are more likely to occur when systems are not thoroughly analyzed. Several recent disastrous events have elucidated the consequences of not performing rigorous risk assessments and/or not eliminating or mitigating the vulnerabilities found. This paper discusses two risk assessment techniques that can aid in identifying complex system vulnerabilities. The topics discussed are development of a risk framework, Failure Mode and Effect Analysis and Event Tree Analysis. Examples of each of these topics are presented.

Title: Polish sign language words recognition with Kinect

Abstract: The paper considers Polish sign language (PSL) words recognition with sensor Kinect. The nearest neighbour classifier with dynamic time warping technique was examined. The classifier was using two sets of features, the first produced by Kinect (in a form of 3D positions of most important joints of observed person body - a skeletal image or a skeleton) and the second describing hands, which were tracked as skin colour regions in the images acquired by Kinect. Obtained feature vectors representing PSL words are clustered in order to discover natural data divisions among them. This step is helpful in revealing possible problems which could occur during recognition and provides additional information about processed data. Results of ten-fold cross-validation tests for the classifier with two feature sets are given. The classifier with data provided by Kinect yielded promising recognition accuracy (89.33%) but in order to obtain better results (98.33%) adding new features responsible for hand shape description should be considered.

Title: Harvesting of semantic metadata from distributed 3D web content

Abstract: The paper presents a method of harvesting semantic metadata from distributed 3D web content. Distributed 3D content may be used for building complex VR/AR-based solutions for human-system interaction. Dependencies between 3D web content are typically more complex than dependencies between standard web pages as they may relate to different aspects of the content - spatial, temporal, structural, logical and behavioural. Building, searching and combining distributed 3D content may be improved by applying the Semantic Web approach. Semantic Web standards enable transformations of embedded semantic descriptions - unambiguously and inextricably linked with the described content - to separate semantic descriptions - intended for content that presents different semantic objects. However, these standards have been intended mostly for 2D web pages and not for 3D web content. The main contribution of this paper is a method of harvesting metadata from semantically described distributed X3D web content. The method conforms to well-established standards for describing both 3D content and semantics of resources, and it facilitates widespread creation, dissemination and reuse of content in a variety of applications on the web.

Title: Design of a distributed system using mobile devices and workflow management for measurement and control of a smart home and health

Abstract: The paper presents design of a distributed system for measurements and control of a smart home including temperatures, light, fire danger, health problems of inhabitants such as increased body temperature, a person falling etc. This is done by integration of mobile devices and standards, distributed service based middleware BeesyCluster and a workflow management system. Mobile devices are used to measure the parameters and are coupled with computers for remote access. The latter is made possible by exposing services in the distributed middleware. Such services can then be integrated into complex workflow applications for constant monitoring and analysis of input data, instant feedback such as turning off lights or heating or notification of medical emergency. Interfaces are defined for particular system components and implementation hints for measurements using the Java Mobile Sensor JSR 256 API are provided.

Title: Undirected graph algebra application for formalization description of information flows

Abstract: The paper described algebra untargeted consistent graphs, allowing for formal, algebraic notation of any network structures including topology representing computer systems and networks. In contrast to the known methods for recording the structure of graphs, the proposed approach, an object is described by an algebraic expression, on which can be carried out various activities to determine or change its properties, for example, by creating a new network structure. The study demonstrated basic algebra, as well as showing its use to describe a popular network topology and computer systems.

Title: Single camera based location estimation with dissimilarity measurement

Abstract: In this paper we present a method that uses a single camera as a passive sensor for location estimation. The implementation is focused on the image processing techniques and dissimilarity measurement. Experimental results have indicated that good state estimates could be obtained, considering very little use of visual information. Consequently, popular cameras can be perceived as a simple and interesting solution for visual odometry and present very promising possibility in autonomous navigation.

Title: Consensus function based on multi-layer networks technique

Abstract: One of the great aspirations of machine learning is the clustering methods. It consists on categorized a set of similar data into different groups based on related properties. The clustering ensemble is used in aim to improve the performance and the stability of the unsupervised classification methods through the concept of weighting. One of the major problems in clustering ensembles is the consensus function. In this paper, we study the amalgamation of clustering techniques, trying to benefit from the strengths of each algorithm and we emerge the problem of combining multiple clustering of a set of objects. A new efficient for Consensus Functions of Cluster Ensembles is proposed based on Multi-layer networks technique. Experiments are carried out on a variety of datasets which highlights our proposed method.

Title: Abdominal muscle behavior and motion sickness during paired visual input with roll motion

Abstract: The study of seated balance, specifically in relation to wheelchair propulsion has the potential to lead to the prevention and treatment of musculoskeletal injuries. To date little study has been done which analyzes the activity of abdominal and back muscles in relation to postural behavior and balance during sitting balance. In this pilot study, the effect of motorized rotational roll movement was analyzed on two subjects with and without visuals in both directions of the individuals. The corresponding muscle activity was recorded by surface electromyography (EMG) in the presence and absence of visual scenery. An assessment of how muscle activity was affected by virtual reality was also conducted, and motion sickness during paired visual input with motion was also examined. The results showed that the dominant factors in abdominal muscle activity were the acceleration and speed of rotational motion and an increase of 20.8% in muscle activity was observed. The results also suggested that motion of the subject with respect to visual display had an inhibitory effect on the motion perception. The findings also suggested that visual scenery during rotational motion had a small effect on the subjects (4.2%), which was possibly caused by placing focus away from maintaining balance. Finally, the study confirmed that the duration of motion with visuals was a major contributor to motion sickness.

Title: Expert rules refinement by solving fuzzy relational equations

Abstract: In this paper, an approach to expert rules refinement within the framework of fuzzy relational calculus is proposed. The system of fuzzy rules can be rearranged as a collection of linguistic solutions of fuzzy relational equations using the composite system of fuzzy terms. Resolution of fuzzy relational equations guarantees the optimal number of fuzzy rules for each output fuzzy term and the optimal geometry of input fuzzy terms for each linguistic solution.

Title: An effort control system for training elite team-sport athletes

Abstract: This paper presents a novel system for effort control in team-sport training, where each component is associated with a particularized program. The system relies on a decision engine that analyzes training data and provides instructions to athletes, and on a sensing infrastructure which monitors athletes' biometrics and movements and gathers environmental data such as humidity or temperature. The prototype has been developed using IMOTE2 and MicaZ sensors under TinyOS and BioHarness biometric belts. The decision technique estimates the ratios of each effort regime, based on best-fit polynomial approximations using historical data from previous training sessions. The complete system results in a virtual coach, operating in real time and automatically. This methodology has been piloted in an experiment with the UCAM Volleyball Murcia team, top of the Spanish national women's volleyball league. Data obtained during training sessions have provided a knowledge base for the algorithms developed and allowed for validation of the results.

Title: Intelligent 3D layout design with shape grammars

Abstract: Shape grammars are generative systems dedicated to specific needs of designers. In the last few years, they have received increased interest especially in building reconstruction and building model generation. We propose to combine the formalism with computational intelligence methods and apply to the 3D layout problem which require efficient search of large and discontinuous spaces. The approach is illustrated by the example of a designing 3D ICs layouts. The presented results have been generated with a use of a dedicated application PerfectShape.

Title: Visual data on tongue and lips in phonemes classification

Abstract: This paper describes the concept of SVM classification of the vowels and some consonants based on visual information gathered from lips shape and tongue position. Support vector describing the lips shapes was extend by the data about tongue position. To minimize the vector dimension, tongue position was classified accordingly to convention used in logopedics. The goal of the experiments is to maximize the effectiveness of classifier for single patient. The class here means possible combination of the lips shapes and tongue position for one vowel but only for selected patient. This work will try to find answer on question: Is is possible to classify phonemes using other than audio information?

Title: The generation of letter-to-sound rules for grapheme-to-phoneme conversion

Abstract: This paper presents an approach to letter-to-sound translation for the Polish language that is a part of a speech recognition system. It describes the process of automatic generation of Polish letter-to-sound (LTS) rules. The LTS rules were trained with a Polish phonetic lexicon, that was extracted from the “wictionary” - a Polish on-line dictionary. This lexicon contains 35.826 entries. We examined a novel method for creating the letter-to-phone allowable pairing, that applies the “IBM Model 1 algorithm. Such automatically generated allowed letter-to-sound pairs were compared with a second pairing map, created by an expert. Both allowable pairing maps were used separately to train the Polish LTS rules. The test results verify that our generated pairing map leads to a more compact LTS model than the expert-made one.

Title: Genetic programming with negative selection for volunteer computing system optimization

Abstract: Volunteer computing systems like BOINC or Comcute are strongly supported by a great number of volunteers who contribute resources of their computers via the Web. So, the high efficiency of such grid system is required, and that is why we have formulated a multi-criterion optimization problem for a volunteer grid system design. In that dilemma, both the cost of the host system and workload of a bottleneck host are minimized. On the other hand, a reliability of this grid structure is maximized. Moreover, genetic programming has been applied to determine the Pareto solutions. Finally, a negative selection procedure to handle constraints has been discussed.

Title: Data-driven performance improvement of control systems for three-tank systems

Abstract: This paper proposes the data-driven performance improvement of low-cost control systems (CSs) for vertical three-tank systems. The MIMO CSs dedicated to two tanks of the three-tank systems consist of two SISO control loops with separately tuned PI controllers. The Modulus Optimum method is applied to initially tune the PI controllers. Optimization problems are defined on the basis of an original objective function which depends on the controller tuning parameters and is expressed as the sum of squared output errors multiplied by variable weights. The performance improvement is achieved by a new convergent Iterative Feedback Tuning (IFT) algorithm which aims the parameter tuning of PI controllers by the experiment-based solving of the optimization problems. The convergence is ensured by the formulation of the parameter update laws in the IFT algorithm as a nonlinear dynamical feedback system in the parameter space and iteration domain and by setting the step sizes to fulfill inequality-type convergence conditions derived from Popov's hyperstability theory. The experimental results for a laboratory vertical three-tank system show the convincing CS performance improvement by few experiments.

Title: Unconventional logic for massively parallel reasoning

Abstract: In this paper, unconventional logic for massive-parallel reasoning is introduced and two examples of simulating natural processes by means of this logic are regarded: chemical (Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction) and biological (dynamics of plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum). In unconventional logic well-formed formulas are defined as streams and there are possible so-called wave sets of formulas (where all members are non-well-founded). This way of simulating is much simpler in applications of unconventional computing than sequential thinking.

Title: Particle swarm optimization techniques. Power systems applications

Abstract: Nowadays, there is a huge interest regarding the use of artificial intelligence techniques. From the associated methods, the current work is focusing on particle swarm optimization (PSO) study. The authors aim to present a synthesis regarding the PSO applications within the power system field. Two issues are addressed within the paper. Firstly, the PSO parameter tuning using mathematical test functions. Secondly, the conclusions are applied in case of optimal power flow (OPF) computing for small scale test power systems. For both issues the methodologies are presented, software tools have been developed. The research work is going to be continued having as a goal to develop a PSO based software designed for transmission network expansion (in case of complex power systems).

Title: Adaboost with SVM using GMM supervector for imbalanced phoneme data

Abstract: In machine learning, AdaBoost with Support vector Machines (SVM) based component classifier have shown to be a successful method for classification on balanced dataset with all classes having relatively similar distribution. However, the success of this method is limited when it is applied for imbalanced datasets. In many real applications, the classification of data with imbalanced proportions will be problematic since the algorithm can be biased and then might predict all the samples into majority classes. Many studies were conducted to overcome imbalance data problem by using hybrid algorithms. In this paper, we propose an improved AdaBoost with SVM based weak learner algorithm using Gaussian Mixture Modeling (GMM) supervectors called GSV-ADSVM. GMM supervectors are constructed applying MAP adaptation of the means of the mixture components based on speech from a target phoneme of TIMIT corpus. Those supervectors will be used as input datasets for the hybrid Adaboost-SVM. The main goal of this paper is to investigate the impact of using GMM supervectors with the boosted SVM in a multi-class phoneme recognition problem with the aim to advance the classification of imbalanced data since certain class of interest have very small size.

Title: Segmentation of cerebral cortex MRI images with artificial neural network (ANN) training

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) results in overall quality that usually calls for human intervention in order to correctly identify details present in the image. More recently, interest has arisen in automated processes that can adequately segment medical image structures into substructures with finer detail than other efforts to-date. Relatively few image processing methods exist that are considered accurate enough for automated MRI image processing where the edge-to-pixel ratio is relatively high, largely due to the inherent pixel noise. ANN training, though ideal for non-linear solutions, is generally considered inefficient for most image processing operations based on the limitations of the most commonly known training algorithms and their derivatives. We present a rapid and accurate method for segmentation of a cerebral cortex image using a unique ANN training algorithm that most notably handles the very large sets of associated training patterns (one per pixel) inherent in an image file. This method also operates on intensity image data converted directly from raw RGB MRI images without any pre-processing.

Title: Application of fuzzy ontological reasoning in an implementation of medical guidelines

Abstract: In this paper we address two problems. The first pertains to implementation of medical guidelines in an e-health system supporting self-management of chronic diseases. The system allows patients to enter observed symptoms and measured parameters, then makes assessment of disease state and informs about necessary actions. We propose to formalize guidelines as sets of fuzzy rules. Fuzziness is introduced to cope with uncertainty resulting from self-observations bias, low quality of sensors and limited patients skills. The second problem is more general. It concerns the reuse of knowledge gathered in ontologies and an application of Semantic Web technologies to perform fuzzy inference. We show that, despite the fact that commonly used ontology languages and supporting tools are not intended to handle vagueness and uncertainty, they can be successfully integrated to represent and execute a set of fuzzy rules. The proposed method consists in refactoring a domain ontology, then introducing additional relations expressing fuzzy properties, encoding Mamdani fuzzy rules in SWRL language and executing them with use of Pellet OWL reasoner. We describe a fuzzy reasoning engine applying this approach and discuss translation of fuzzy rules to SWRL constructs taking as example a complete set of rules formalizing a medical guideline for asthma control assessment.

Title: Improvement of assistive robot behavior by experience-based learning

Abstract: Robots designed for assisting humans in their homes need to adapt to the changing requirements of daily life. This requires multimodal sensor systems as well as learning strategies for understanding new goals and for recognizing new objects. However, coping with changes is not limited to environmental sensing. In order to achieve full autonomy, the robots must adapt their behavior due to good and bad experiences made. Concepts and first results of modelling intelligent sensing and adaptive behavior in an artificial mind as well as of merging mind and machine are presented in this paper.

Title: A fuzzy framework with modeling language for type 1 and type 2 application development

Abstract: Fuzzy logic, Type-1 and Type-2, is well suited for human systems interactions because they provides a natural way of implementing linguistic terms from human experts. Existing fuzzy frameworks, however, provide limited support for Type-2. They also tend to be fairly complicated and/or have limited portability. This paper introduces a fuzzy framework for building a Type-1Type-2 fuzzy controller. A “wizard” application and modeling language are supported to provide an easy-to-use interface for creating a fuzzy inference system. The benefits of this framework are: (1) Increased understanding of fuzzy systems implementation via easy-to-use visual tools; (2) Reduced development time; (3) A standardized and portable codebase; (4) Easy configuration via XML; (5) Support for both Type-1 and Type-2 fuzzy sets and rules. The framework is tested and solves a maze problem using both Type-1 and Type-2 implementations.

Title: Feasibility study of optimization of a genetic algorithm for traffic network division for distributed road traffic simulation

Abstract: This paper deals with optimization of a genetic algorithm for road traffic network division for distributed road traffic simulation which we developed. Two approaches for finding of optimal setting of the genetic algorithm are considered an optimizing genetic algorithm and a systematic testing of possible settings. Since both approaches are expected to be extremely computation-consuming their distributed versions are proposed and a feasibility study is evaluated.

Title: Logic of human-system-interaction in planning complex strategies for chemical syntheses

Abstract: New HSI-logic in planning complex chemical syntheses are illustrated by application of Corey's or Ugi-Dugundji approaches to design of new pharmaceuticals. The second. approach (known worldwide as the D-U model) allows to generate synthetic pathways to required compounds, neglecting very expensive process of searching through enormously large databases on chemical reactions. The main features of both approaches are briefly discussed, and finally our own extension of the D-U model based on the application of various methods of machine learning is briefly discussed.

Title: Thresholding strategies for large scale multi-label text classifier

Abstract: This article presents an overview of thresholding methods for labeling objects given a list of candidate classes' scores. These methods are essential to multi-label classification tasks, especially when there are a lot of classes which are organized in a hierarchy. Presented techniques are evaluated using the state-of-the-art dedicated classifier on medium scale text corpora extracted from Wikipedia. Obtained results show that the classification performance can be improved with the use of new class-specific thresholding methods, which set decision values depending on each candidate class separately.

Title: Application of genetic algorithms and maxplus system formalism in optimization of discrete system processes

Abstract: This paper presents results of using some methods for optimization of the discrete system cyclic processes. We consider the issue of maintaining the throughput of the system. Modelling and control is at the operational level. The processes under consideration are represented by the formalism Timed Event Graph as a particular case of Timed Petri Nets. The suggested max-plus system and simulation methods are useful in investigating selected properties of the network models. The cycle time of the system was adopted as a measure of the system performance. Genetic algorithm is applied in finding the solution to the optimization problem. This paper extends the simple genetic algorithm and proposes a new methodology to handle a complex variety of variables.

Title: Analog circuits testing by means of walsh-hadamard spectrum of supply current transient state monitoring

Abstract: The paper presents a practical technique of the analog circuits testing based on its supply current waveform evaluation. The decision about an actual circuit under test state is made during the circuit power turn on stage. The step of the supply voltage with an assumed rise time stimulates the circuit and the differential of its current response is decomposed by means of Walsh-Hadamard transform. The analysis of the spectra in the sequences domain allows to detect faults presence effectively. Finally, after the circuit testing on launching stage, only in case of its healthy state confirmation, it is admitted for use. Thanks to the minimal computational effort necessary for the applied kind of transformation, the proposed method is suitable to build in reliable systems with the use of a cheap microcontroller. Besides, the numerical complexity of the method can be easily reduced additionally by the set of the observed spectra points minimization by means of genetic algorithm.

Title: Soft DBSCAN: Improving DBSCAN clustering method using fuzzy set theory

Abstract: Clustering is one of the most valuable methods of computational intelligence field, in which sets of related objects are cataloged into clusters. Almost all of the well-known clustering algorithms require input number of clusters which is hard to determine but have a significant influence on the clustering result. Furthermore, the majority is not robust enough towards noisy data. In contrast, density based methods, such as DBSCAN, have obvious advantages over explicit samples. They discover the number of clusters, as well as, they detect noises. Additionally, the shape of such clusters can also be irregular. However, they have difficulties in handling the challenges posed by the collection of natural data which is often vague. This paper presents an efficient clustering technique, named “Soft DBSCAN” that combines DBSCAN and fuzzy set theory. Our new method is galvanized by Fuzzy C Means in the way of using the fuzzy membership functions. The results of our method show that it is efficient not only in handling noises, contrary to Fuzzy C Means, but also, able to assign one data point into more than one cluster. Simulative experiments are carried out on a variety of datasets, throughout different evaluation's criteria, which highlight the soft DBSCAN's effectiveness and cluster validity to check the good quality of clustering results.

Title: Quantitative and qualitative analysis of globally distributed team collaboration in design and development of software

Abstract: The goal of this study is to understand the dynamics of collaboration within globally-distributed teams working in a realistic Human-System Interaction design and software engineering context. Quantitative data on communications were collected by capturing virtually all of the communications between the team members. Qualitative data were collected through the interviews conducted by the instructors. The projects successfully ended in the software implementation of the front end of an Android app based on the Human-System Interaction design. The results reveal some of the challenges associated with working in interdisciplinary and global settings and suggest areas of caution for future such HSI educational experiences.

Title: A web-based ETL tool for data integration process

Abstract: Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) is a fundamental process used to populate a data warehouse and an important step towards data integration which is a key step for data preprocessing for many data mining projects. The objective of this project is to create a simple web based ETL tool which can be accessed by anyone with internet access. This ETL tool is also supported by a brief on-line tutorial on ETL process. The combination of tool and tutorial makes an ideal self-paced interactive learning tool for a beginning ETL learner. Guests will have limited access to this tool and registered users can have complete access. Using this tool, data can be extracted from text files or MySQL tables, integrated and loaded into target MySQL tables. Before loading the data into target MySQL tables, various transformations can also be applied to them.

Title: Accessible telehealth — Leveraging consumer-level technologies and social networking functionalities for senior care

Abstract: The increasing cost of healthcare represents a serious challenge to most developed countries. Telehealth has been widely promoted as a technology to make healthcare more effective and affordable. However, current telehealth systems suffer from vendor lock-in and high cost, and are designed for managing chronic diseases, rather than preventing them. In this paper we evaluate technologies for supporting senior health consumers. Based on this we propose a framework for a novel telehealth system overcoming many of the shortcomings of existing technologies. The new system is web-based, has a Facebook-like plug-in architecture for adding new health applications, and incorporates social networking functionalities. We discuss the challenges in implementing the system, and summarize a user study evaluating the system. Our results demonstrate that health consumers have a positive view of this new telehealth technology, and that it can positively change the attitude of users towards their health.

Title: Kinect cane: Object recognition aids for the visually impaired

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel concept for helping the visually impaired know what kind of object there is in an environment. This concept is implemented as a cane system that selects a target object based on a user's demand, recognizes the object from depth data obtained by a Microsoft Kinect sensor, and returns the recognition results via a tactile device. The proposed system is evaluated through a user study where one blindfolded subject actually uses the system to find chairs in an experimental environment. The experimental results indicate that the system is promising as means of helping the visually impaired recognize objects.

Title: A prototype design for wireless EMG capturing system with stimulation feedback

Abstract: In this paper, the authors propose a new wireless EMG measuring device for watching over human. The authors has developed a unique wireless EMG monitoring device called “VAMPIRE-BAT”, which is an acronym that stands for “Variables Adjustable Multi-Purpose Intelligent Remote-controlled Electrode for Bio-signal Amplification and Transmission”, in their previous works. The most remarkable feature of the device is on-line parameter adjustment ability, which means an operator can tune various parameters including analog constants remotely and dynamically thanks to bi-directional communication between the device and receiver PC. This time they newly applied a new major upgrade electric stimulus feedback. The new device can stimulate human electrically using the same electrodes as those for measuring. In other words, pin-point precision stimulus feedback can be applied at the measuring point. The authors consider that such a feedback may be useful for helping people working for a certain task by prompting to or not to do some action intuitive and reflective way. However, there are several concerns to be clarified. For example, the way to apply electric stimulus, energy supply, potential device size, effects of electric impulse on CPU and wireless communication, and so on. The authors show a prototype design and some preliminary experiments and their results to argue these issues.

Title: Hemodynamic characteristics for improvement of EEG-BCI performance

Abstract: Although brain computer interfaces (BCI) based on electroencephalographic (EEG) signals have been studied increasingly over decades, their performance is still limited in two main aspects. First, the shorter the EEG epochs, the more difficult the detection of a BCI command. Second, BCI commands are often misclassified while the subject is not performing any tasks by not focusing on a command (offset condition) because the EEG characteristics of the offset condition are not unique. In order to circumvent these limitations, the hemodynamic fluctuations in the brain during stimulation with steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) were measured using near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) simultaneously with EEG. The offset condition is distinguished from the onset condition (focusing on a command) with extracted NIRS features through the design of low-pass filter. BCI command estimates were based on EEG SSVEP response. Simultaneous evaluation of EEG and NIRS was shown to improve the SSVEP classification, notably including the offset condition as an independent class, using a novel offset condition estimation approach. For 13 subjects, wrong classification for 9 classes with inclusion of offset condition were decreased. This proposed bimodal approach including the offset condition detection may render current BCI systems more reliable.

Title: A system for identification of dangerous spots and POIs for the blind and visually impaired

Abstract: The paper presents the course of work on construction of a prototype system for demarcating dangerous areas and points of interest for blind and visually impaired people in large urbanized areas. The project included identification of locations requiring to be marked, development of the method of marking the identified zones, and designing the transmission/reception system for identification of both zone and user. Further, vibration signals to be used for conveying information to the user were selected together with the method of teaching blind and visually impaired persons (including children and young people) in identification of dangerous spots and points of interest (POIs) in a large city environment with the use of the proposed system. The paper shows consecutive stages of development of the transmission/reception system and its final effect in the form of a prototype.

Title: Impression analysis for robot behavior using brain monitoring

Abstract: This paper reports difference human impression CG and actual robot. Questionnaire for Semantic Differential(SD) method are optimized using factor analysis, and the human impression was evaluated objectively using NIRS. The robot behaviors are designed based on Anna Freud and Kestenberg's theory. In the motion design, the distance between human and robot is considered by reffering the personal space. As result, it was confirmed significantly that the CG robot can be utilized for an impression analysis of the robot feature's and motion similarly with the actual robot. Moreover, it was found that the difference in the impression can be found by monitoring the brain area Fpl.

Title: A review of emotion recognition methods based on keystroke dynamics and mouse movements

Abstract: The paper describes the approach based on using standard input devices, such as keyboard and mouse, as sources of data for the recognition of users' emotional states. A number of systems applying this idea have been presented focusing on three categories of research problems, i.e. collecting and labeling training data, extracting features and training classifiers of emotions. Moreover the advantages and examples of combining standard input devices with other sources of information on human emotions have been also described. Eventually some conclusions from the review have been drawn.

Title: Affect-awareness framework for intelligent tutoring systems

Abstract: The paper proposes a framework for construction of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS), that take into consideration student emotional states and make affective interventions. The paper provides definitions of `affect-aware systems' and `affective interventions' and describes the concept of the affect-awareness framework. The proposed framework separates emotion recognition from its definition, processing and making decisions on interventions. The components of the proposed framework were described, including trustworthiness model and affect-aware control mechanisms, and a case study of the proposed framework implementation in GERDA Intelligent Tutoring System was also presented. Presented evidence allows to state, that affect-awareness framework allows to reduce the risk of unnecessary and disturbing application intervention and improves application adaptability and trustworthiness.

Title: Adaptive architecture for assisted living systems

Abstract: Recent achievements of telemedicine and surveillance techniques open new challenges for development of assisted living systems for elderly or disabled. This paper presents an universal approach to designing of multimodal health monitoring systems with regard to a paradigm of ubiquitous and personalized medicine. The design combines advantages of intelligent reprogrammable sensors, flexibility of reconfigurable networks built on human body area or embedded in building infrastructures and automatic, person-dependent decision making based on presumptions and experience represented in artificial intelligence. Considering these key features leads to a system design suitable for majority of human surveillance purposes including home care, hospices, rehabilitation and sport training. The paper also presents a prototype system designed accordingly to proposed rules and tested in some experimental setups intended to simulate volunteers' homes. The results confirm that the system adapts to environment-specific relations, provides seamless monitoring with no limit of indoor and outdoor mobility and adapts to subject's habits in recognition of normal, suspected and dangerous events.

Title: Accompany: Acceptable robotiCs COMPanions for AgeiNG Years — Multidimensional aspects of human-system interactions

Abstract: With changes in life expectancy across the world, technologies enhancing well-being of individuals, specifically for older people, are subject to a new stream of research and development. In this paper we present the ACCOMPANY project, a pan-European project which focuses on home companion technologies. The projects aims to progress beyond the state of the art in multiple areas such as empathic and social human-robot interaction, robot learning and memory visualisation, monitoring persons and chores at home, and technological integration of these multiple approaches on an existing robotic platform, Care-O-Bot®3 and in the context of a smart-home environment utilising a multitude of sensor arrays. The resulting prototype from integrating these developments undergoes multiple formative cycles and a summative evaluation cycle towards identifying acceptable behaviours and roles for the robot for example role as a butler or a trainer. Furthermore, the evaluation activities will use an evaluation grid in order to assess achievement of the identified user requirements, formulated in form of distinct scenarios. Finally, the project considers ethical concerns and by highlighting principles such as autonomy, independence, enablement, safety and privacy, it embarks on providing a discussion medium where user views on these principles and the existing tension between some of these principles for example tension between privacy and autonomy over safety, can be captured and considered in design cycles and throughout project developments.

Title: GiraffPlus: Combining social interaction and long term monitoring for promoting independent living

Abstract: Early detection and adaptive support to changing individual needs related to ageing is an important challenge in today's society. In this paper we present a system called GiraffPlus that aims at addressing such a challenge and is developed in an on-going European project. The system consists of a network of home sensors that can be automatically configured to collect data for a range of monitoring services; a semi-autonomous telepresence robot; a sophisticated context recognition system that can give high-level and long term interpretations of the collected data and respond to certain events; and personalized services delivered through adaptive user interfaces for primary users. The system performs a range of services including data collection and analysis of long term trends in behaviors and physiological parameters (e.g. relating to sleep or daily activity); warnings, alarms and reminders; and social interaction through the telepresence robot. The latter is based on the Giraff telepresence robot, which is already in place in a number of homes. A distinctive aspect of the project is that the GiraffPlus system will be installed and evaluated in at least 15 homes of elderly people. This paper provides a general overview of the GiraffPlus system and its evaluation.

Title: A multisensor detector of a sleep apnea for using at home

Abstract: Diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea usually involves polysomnographic analysis, which unfortunately requires overnight stay in a specialized clinic and is very uncomfortable for a patient. This paper describes the method and apparatus for recording a set of signals to detect sleep apnea. The device records the following signals simultaneously: three-channel ECG, respiratory functions, signals from the accelerometer, and snoring sounds. Measurements are carried out during the night, in the patient's home. Algorithm for automatic analysis of the data can be used to detect sleep apnea and hypopnea.

Title: Everyday usage of home telecare services in England

Abstract: Deployment of telecare is being driven by policy in different European contexts, however little is known about the utilization of telecare following installation. This study provides an analysis of contact data within one telecare call centre in North East England. Characteristics of service users that influence use is presented. 50.6% of contact episodes were due to activation of devices and sensors; 17.7% to service users contacting the call centre for support, referral to other services; and 31.3% to managing the system.

Title: Can telecare contribute to an independent life at home with 100? A glance to the UK and initial experiences of the German LOEWE field test on age appropriate sensor based assistance in real estate

Abstract: Although telecare is a well-known concept in the UK, the situation in Germany is different. The German LOEWE project “Field test on age appropriate sensor based assistance in real estate” enables exploration of the decision process of using the technology by the service user. This gives a valuable insight to supporting and inhibiting factors in providing telecare services in Germany. This contribution presents the methodology and findings from the initial experiences.

Title: Design and older people's real issues: Experiences of an engineer assessing technology in the user's home

Abstract: Engineers tend to confine themselves to designing technology for users in the lab. The authors wished to explore exposure to the real-world technology needs of older people by assessing technology use (via a universal design questionnaire) in the older person's own home. Following a series of home visits to older people and interviewing them on technology use, the authors were exposed to a number of experiences obtainable only from such visits. These are reported on in this paper in a quasi-chronological order with a view to assisting and encouraging engineers to conduct similar in-home assessments so as to design technologies which address the real (holistic) needs of the older person.

Title: Social robots helping people with dementia: Assessing efficacy of social robots in the nursing home environment

Abstract: This paper explores the challenges of testing the efficacy of social robots in the nursing home environment. The findings of two projects exploring the use of PARO and Giraff (a telepresence robot) are outlined. The challenges experienced by the researchers when undertaking a randomized controlled trial and using a case study design to test the social robots with people with dementia are examined. While randomized controlled trials are advocated, in early testing of the social robots the case study approach has the advantage that researchers can manipulate and adjust the intervention as issues arise. This can assist in the preparation of a protocol for testing in a randomized controlled trial at a later date.

Title: The impact of ICT-based telecare technology on quality of life of people with dementia: Review of the literature

Abstract: This paper presents the findings of a literature review that explored the impact of assistive technologies (AT) on quality of life (QOL) for people with dementia. Of the 799 identified papers only 18 studies met the eligibility criteria. The review concludes that few empirical studies involve people with dementia using AT. There is a clear indication that people with mild to moderate dementia are accepting of AT. Technologies that require minimal interaction from the service user and appliances specifically designed to address particular problems led to successful outcomes.

Title: Planar motion estimation using omnidirectional camera and laser rangefinder

Abstract: The vision based motion estimation has been investigated in the last few years. Although some progresses have been made in the assumption of planar, still there are no methods satisfying the high accuracy and real-time with absolute translation. This paper proposes a method to estimate vehicle motion by the fusion of omnidirectional camera and laser rangefinder to overcome the drawbacks mentioned above. The vehicle motion contains of rotation and translation components. The rotation is estimated based on the simple but efficient edge matching method by using camera. The absolute translation problem is solved based on ICP method by using laser rangefinder. The experiments were carried out using an electric vehicle with a camera mounted on the roof and a laser device mounted on the bumper. In order to evaluate the motion estimation, the vehicle positions were compared with GPS information and superimposed onto aerial images collected by Google map API. The experimental results showed that the error is 1.1 times smaller and the computational cost is 10.4 times faster than the 1-Point RANSAC method. Also, the error is 4.1 times smaller than the method based on appearance color features.

Title: High resolution 3D content creation using unconstrained and uncalibrated cameras

Abstract: An increasing number of applications require 3D content. However, its creation from real-world data either necessitates expensive equipment, artistic skills, or is constrained, for example, by the range of the utilized sensors. Image-based modeling is rapidly increasing in popularity since cameras are very affordable, widely available, and have a wide image acquisition range suitable for objects of vastly different size. The technique is especially suitable for mobile robotics involving low cost equipment and robots with a light payload, for example, small UAVs. In this paper we describe a novel image-based modeling system, which produces high-quality 3D content automatically from a collection of unconstrained and uncalibrated 2D images. The system estimates camera parameters and a 3D scene geometry using Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Bundle Adjustment techniques. The point cloud density of 3D scene components is enhanced by exploiting silhouette information of the scene. This hybrid approach dramatically improves the reconstruction of objects with few visual features, for example, unicolored objects, and improves surface smoothness. A high quality texture is created by parameterizing the reconstructed objects using a segmentation and charting approach which also works for objects which are not homeomorphic to a sphere. The resulting parameter space contains one chart for each surface segment. A texture map is created by back projecting the best fitting input images onto each surface segment, and smoothly fusing them together over the corresponding chart by using graph-cut techniques.

Title: Tracking visitors with sensor poles for robot's museum guide tour

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a robot system which can take visitors on guided tours in a museum. When we consider developing a robot capable of giving a tour of an actual museum, we must implement a robot system able to measure the location and orientation of the robot and visitors using bearing sensors installed in a specific environment. Although many previous methods employed markers or tags attached to the robot to obtain positional information through cameras, it is not easy to situate sensors in the environment itself. SLAM is also used to localize the position of the robot. However, its robustness may not be sufficient when the system is deployed in an actual real-life situation since there will be many people moving freely around the robot. On the other hand, the robot needs information pertaining to both tour attendees and other visitors in the vicinity, in order to give a tour for the attendees. Therefore, we propose a new robot system which consists of simple devices such as multiple laser range finders attached to a pole. By just placing the sensor poles, we could track the location and orientation of the robot and visitors at the same time. We then conducted experiments to confirm the effectiveness and accuracy of our system. In addition, we conducted demonstrative experiments that our robot takes three visitors to the guide tour.

Title: Micro-vibration array using SMA actuators for the screening of diabetes

Abstract: Diabetes mellitus is a group of metabolic diseases which causes high blood sugar to a person, due to the functional problems of the pancreas or the metabolism. For a person with diabetes, glucose would not be used properly in the metabolic system, and cause health problems, such as polyphagia, polyuria and polydipsia, since glucose is the main source of energy for the body cells. Symptoms of untreated diabetes would be damaged by the high blood sugar in vessels, and this starts to destroy capillary vessels to lower the sensitivity of tactile sensations, then effects to various organs and nerve systems. The authors pay attention to the decline of the sensitivity of tactile sensations associated with diabetes, and develop a non-destructive screening method of the level of diabetes using a novel micro-vibration actuator that employs a shape-memory alloy wire. The actuators are arranged in an array, and various tactile stimuli are generated by just controlling the driving current signals. The tactile stimuli are presented to symptom's, index and middle fingers., and he/she responds to the stimuli by answering how they are perceived. We made an experiment in a medical clinic., and examined the relation between the Hb Al C values and tactile stimuli.

Title: Recognition of visual signals and firing positions for virtual military training systems

Abstract: In this paper, we present visual hand and arm signals recognition and rifle firing positions estimation for virtual military training systems which perform various military tasks in the virtual environments. Among them, we deal with the platoon leader training and rifle firing position training for various military situations. In the platoon leader training, the trainee whose role is a platoon leader keeps command and control over his/her members by visual signals. The proposed visual signals and rifle firing positions recognition system exploits the optical motion capture system. For the real-time performance, our recognition method localizes the head and hands in the user-centered partitions of 3D space and analyzes their temporal transitions, and finally makes a simple decision to classify the visual hand and arm signals. Experimental results show the evaluation of the proposed method.

Title: Introducing dead bands within two-dimensional clusters of user data to improve data classification

Abstract: Methods are described to create more accurate sub sets of user data by introducing dead bands into data clusters. User data is collected and then mined. That produces clusters of data. Dead bands are then generated to delineate and describe the data in the clusters more accurately. This is accomplished by classifying data inside the newly created dead bands as NOT being in either of two or more clusters. For example, three clusters are generated from two. If the two were YES and NO then another set of DON'T KNOW is introduced. The new set improves the precision of choices made using data in the YES and the NO clusters. Dead bands are introduced by establishing a radius from the corners of 2-D shapes containing the clusters or by establishing a horizontal or vertical line in parallel with the edges. Each radius or edge encompasses 80% of user data nearest to the corner or edge of the data set. 20% are outside and excluded from their original set. If lines do not overlap, then a dead-band is created to contain user data that is not as confident. That increases the likelihood of accurate decisions being made about the new sets of user data. Case studies are described to demonstrate that.

Title: Iterative vanishing point estimation based on DBSCAN for omnidirectional image

Abstract: Regarding the autonomous of robot navigation, vanishing point (VP) plays an important role in visual robot applications such as iterative estimation of rotation angle for automatic control as well as scene understanding. Autonomous navigation systems must be able to recognize feature descriptors. Consequently, this navigating ability can help the system to identify roads, corridors, and stairs; ensuring autonomous navigation along the environments mentioned before the vanishing point detection is proposed. In this paper, the authors propose solutions for finding the vanishing point in real time based density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN). First, we proposed to extract the longest segments of lines from the edge frame. Second, the set of intersection points for each pair of line segments are extracted by computing Lagrange coefficients. Finally, by using DBSCAN the VP is estimated. Preliminary results are performed and tested on a group of consecutive frames undertaken at Nam-gu Ulsan, South Korea to prove its effectiveness.

Title: Gaze tracking in multi-display environment

Abstract: This paper presents the basic ideas of eye and gaze tracking in multiple-display environment. The algorithm for display detection and identification is described as well as the rules for gaze interaction in multi display environment. The core of the method is to use special LED markers and eye and scene tracking glasses. Scene tracking camera registers markers position which is then represented as a cloud of points. Analyzing the mutual positions of detected points the algorithm estimates screen/displays position. Display number is assigned based on special information marker. Described project shows the possibility of hands free interaction in MDE. It also presents how to register visual attention when information is dispersed on several screens.

Title: Optimization of a genetic algorithm for road traffic network division using a distributed/parallel genetic algorithm

Abstract: In this paper, a distributed/parallel genetic algorithm for the optimization of the parameters settings (e.g., the number of generations, the type of selection, etc.) of a genetic algorithm for the road traffic network division is described. Using this approach, new settings of the parameters of the dividing genetic algorithm were obtained. With these parameters, the dividing genetic algorithm yields better road traffic networks divisions than with the original parameters, which were set based on a preliminary testing. The distributed/parallel optimizing genetic algorithm is described in detail as well as its results and the following testing of the dividing genetic algorithm.

Title: Where students go and how they do: Wi-Fi location data versus academic performance

Abstract: Arguably students' academic performance is one of the key areas that a university should focus on and perform further analysis on available data. One of the primary objectives of this research is to analyse the Wi-Fi AMP (Access Module Processor) data gathered by the Information Services Department of University of Portsmouth and determine how students are spending their time on university campus. Later these data have been used to examine if this information can be related to the academic performance of the student. With the analysed Wi-Fi data and academic records of the students a preliminary model has been created which tries to show how the time spent by the students in different types of location are correlated.

Title: Using animated visualisation in Computer Assisted Language Learning

Abstract: Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL) uses computers in the language learning process. The design and development of CALL resources is difficult and sometimes the potential of HCI in the process is overlooked. This paper provides an overview of how the CALLIPSO (CALL for Irish for Parents Students and Others) system uses animated visualisation to demonstrate words are pronounced in Irish. Irish is an orthographically deep language and the pronunciation of a word is sometimes not immediately obvious to a learner. The CALLISPO system combines research findings from HCI and user-modelling to provide an interactive learning resource for Irish.

Title: Analysis of rowing based on handle trajectory

Abstract: The paper presents an analysis of a rowing technique and the participant's fatigue based on the handle's trajectory. The rowing was recorded with the use of Vicon motion capture. Seven non-rowers were participants in the research. 42 strokes were analysed in three phases of rowing. Two theses: (i) “handle trajectory indicates the fatigue while rowing” and (ii) “the rowing technique may be assessed by analysing the handle trajectory” were proven. The presented research concerns the following aspects: (i) handle trajectory analysis in a designated range (specified by two markers positions attached to the ergometer), (ii) duration analysis of the incorrect rowing technique (in time domain), (iii) tilt analysis based on the angle of the handle's position relative to the floor (determined using two markers attached to the handle) and (iv) handle's velocity analysis (determined using one marker attached to the handle). The participants fatigue is indicated by two analysed factors: stroke time and the handle's velocity. The research concerns three stages of rowing selected in a way that the different fatigue phases were expected to be visible. The average stroke time increases in the following stages: by 0.13 second and by 0.6 second respectively. While rowing, the handle's velocity is decreased. The rowing technique is described by parameters such as: the proper handle's position within set boundaries, the surface area encompassed by the handle's trajectory outside the designated range, time of the incorrect rowing technique and the handle's tilt. The surface area clearly shows that in the final stages the movements are more incorrect than initially. The mean values of the tilt indicate that due to the fatigue the technique worsens in the middle and the final rowing stages. It is observed the participants tilt the handle to the right while rowing. It clearly indicates irregular forces acting on the handle. There is a difference in muscle strength of both arms in the participants of this research.

Title: Utilization of graph coarsening for improving of results of a genetic algorithm for road traffic network division

Abstract: In this paper, the optimization of a genetic algorithm for the road traffic network division using the graph coarsening is discussed. Since each road traffic network is basically a graph, the main idea is to coarsen a large road traffic network to obtain a smaller (i.e., coarser) network. This smaller road traffic network can be then divided into required number of sub-networks using our division method based on a genetic algorithm. The division of the coarser network can be then projected to the original road traffic network. The coarsening algorithm, which utilizes the geographical coordinates of the crossroads (i.e., nodes of the graph) is described in detail and tested.

Title: An interactive training system of motor learning by imitation and speech instructions for children with autism

Abstract: This paper presents an interactive training platform of motor learning using movement imitation and synchronous speech instruction. This platform enables a child with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and a robot to imitate each other. A robot can ask a child to copy its action and instruct human how to adjust his/her action to match its action. A robot can also ask a child to coach it, which is able to elicit children's response to increase their communication. The platform is built up by a NAO humanoid robot that demonstrates actions, and a depth camera that captures child's actions. We scaled the skeleton tracking data in order to evaluate the consistence of actions between human and robot. The pilot tests on both children with and without ASD have shown that our framework is flexible and convenient for assisting intervention, and that the synchronous speech instructions to some extend facilitate children with ASD to perform their actions for motor learning.

Title: Electromyography based handwriting recognition system using LM-BP Neural Network

Abstract: With the development of technology, Human-Computer Interface (HCI) system is playing a more and more important role in our daily life. HCI is a way to set up connections and to transfer information between human and computer. Pattern recognition based on Surface Electromyography (SEMG) is one of the most important HCI technologies. To make the input device of electronic products more portable to satisfy the people' need of interacting with computer (especially disabled people), this research proposes an SEMG-based handwriting recognition system based on LM-BP (Back Propagation) Neural Network. In the aspect of signal preprocessing, this thesis tries to use some new features of signals to reflect the features of signals better. In the aspect of pattern recognition, LM-BP Neural Networking is applied to design a system that is suitable for SEMG-based model training and recognition. Compared with the existing system based on Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm and the system based on Hidden Markov Model (HMM), the training times and training time have been reduced a lot, which makes the SEMG-based handwriting recognition system more practical.

Title: Control of mobile robot for remote medical examination: Design concepts and users' feedback from experimental studies

Abstract: In this article we discuss movement control of a ReMeDi medical mobile robot from the user perspective. The control is essentially limited to the level of operator actions where the operator is a member of a nursing staff. Two working modes are the base of considerations: long distance (LD) and short distance (SD) movement. In this context two robot control techniques are the subject of study: manual with use of a gamepad and “point and click” on a map that is related to autonomous motion with use of an onboard navigation system. In the SD mode the user manually operates the robot, that is close to a laying down patient on a settee. In the LD mode the mobile base moves autonomously in a space shared with people to the desired position. Two user studies were conducted. The results show that from the perspective of LD mode the autonomous navigation is efficient and reduces the burden of the medical personnel. In the SD case, the results show that the users were able to precisely position the robot. Besides, the users perceived the manual control with the gamepad as intuitive. In all cases the medical personnel consider this technology as safe and useful. Safety is also confirmed by patients.

Title: Comparison of online adaptive learning algorithms for myoelectric hand control

Abstract: Pattern recognition (PR) based myoelectric hand control has become a research focus in the field of rehabilitative engineer and intelligent control. However, the state of the art method is hardly adopted for clinical use because of signal interfered by shift, fatigue and user-unfriendly of retraining. The aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of different kinds of online algorithms in classifying the myoelectric hand motions, and reveal the key factors to classification accuracy of online learning algorithms. Two groups of experiments on intra-session and inter-session were designed to evaluate the classification and recognition performance of overall methods. The comparison results show that the second-order online learning algorithms outperformed the first-order algorithms in classification and recognition. Soft confidence-weighted learning performs best with 99% classification rate in same session and over 85% recognition rate in different session. This paper uncovers the online learning with large margin and confidence weight can always acquire a good property. In addition, online learning algorithms retrain the classification model by incorporating the testing data to the previous model by measuring the changes between the predicted label and true label which can improve the performance in long-term use.

Title: Fusion approach for real-time mapping street atmospheric pollution concentration

Abstract: The real-time mapping of street atmospheric pollution concentration does play an important role because its knowledge is crucial for strategy-makers to make more effective control strategies to decrease urban atmospheric pollution and improving urban atmospheric environment. Combining the conventional methods (e.g. the dispersion model prediction and neural network prediction) and mobile measurement technology (e.g. the GMAP vehicle) which their characteristics are complementary, a linear model is proposed and then a fusion approach called weighting filter derived from the concept of Kalman filter. Moreover, a self-tuning regulator is introduced to adjust the parameters of filter for the changing noise statistical characteristics over time which mainly caused by season switch. The performances of asymptotic stability and asymptotic optimality are both mathematically proven. Finally a simulation test is conducted to verify this approach.

Title: Epileptic Spike Detection with EEG using artificial Neural Networks

Abstract: Epilepsy is a neurological disease that causes seizures in its victims that can lead to physical injury or even death in some circumstances. It is caused by excessive, synchronous abnormal firing of neurons in the brain. This chronic disease has no known cure and affects millions of people worldwide but can be managed through various methods. The successful treatment is dependent upon correct identification of the origin of the seizures within a brain. One major challenge for doctors is the analysis of the immense amount of data collected by electroencephalogram (EEG) devices. In order to identify a region of the brain that causes epileptic seizures, millions of samples must be analyzed manually by a trained eye to find interictal spikes that emanate from the afflicted region of the brain. This paper presents a method for automatic interictal spike detection while minimizing false positives. In this way, it eliminates the lengthy, manual process currently used by doctors. Analyzing real world data, the presented Neural Network Epileptic Spike Detector (NNESD) showed a PPV of 72.67% and sensitivity of 82.68% on average over 300 trained networks on a single channel of EEG.

Title: Natural interface for robotic arm controlling based on inertial motion capture

Abstract: This article presents new developed natural interface for robotic arm remote controlling. The interface is built with use of inertial motion trackers. There are used two types of motion trackers. The first tracker type is Xsens Xbus Kit tracker which is mounted on the operator's arm and the second is type is Razer Hydra Controller which is attached to the controlled robot. Hydra controller is used to determine robotic arm localization in 3D space because of that the robotic arm taken for the interface evaluation is very simple and has not special equipment for this purpose. This article describes algorithms developed for processing inertial motion data for the robot steering purposes. One of the most difficult problem which was resolved in sufficient manner and described in this article is processing acceleration data to estimate linear position of the robotic arm adequate to operator's motion. The article present results of algorithms' parameter values selections and results of practical evaluation of the interface.

Title: Performances of surface EMG and Ultrasound signals in recognizing finger motion

Abstract: This paper compared the performances of the surface electromyography (sEMG) with Ultrasound(US) signals in finger motion recognition. Compared to traditional sEMG-based human machine interface (HMI), the ultrasound can provide some information about the morphological changes of muscles and has higher resolution. It is possible for the US-based HMI to recognize some more dexterous hand gesture especially for some finger motions. In the experiment, the subjects were instructed to perform 14 different finger motions. The sEMG signals and the ultrasound images were collected simultaneously. The 2-fold cross-validation with LDA classifier was used to analyze the accuracy. The mean accuracy of US-based HMI was nearly 96.37% while the sEMG was 92.41%. One-way ANOVA analysis showed that the US-based HMI had a significantly higher classification accuracy than sEMG-based HMI. What's more, the difference between individuals and finger motions of ultrasound was significantly smaller than that of sEMG. The US-based HMI performed better and more stable than sEMG, which may imply that ultrasound has a great potential to be an alternative method to sEMG regarding precise control, or it can corporate with sEMG to achieve a better HMI.

Title: Location problem for traffic emission monitors

Abstract: In order to mitigate the air pollution caused by traffic, the monitoring of on-road vehicle emission is really an urgent issue. The Vehicle Emission Remote Sensing System (VERSS) is a promising technology to solve this problem. But there is scarcely any available location strategy for traffic emission monitors yet to our knowledge, which restraints the use of monitors on a large scale of traffic network. In this paper, we make some efforts to solve a novel location problem in the transportation domain, that is, we look for the minimum subset of roads on which traffic emission monitors should be located, thus we can detect as many on-road vehicles as possible. We explicate how to transform the location problem to some graph problems and give the problem formulation mathematically. Then a two-step algorithm is designed to find the set of roads to locate monitors. The simulation test verify its availability. And in the last section some problems that should be studied further are presented at the end of the paper.

Title: Scalable timeline visualization

Abstract: Visualization of the timelines is commonly used in many different areas, such as historical education, medical systems, criminal investigations or social networks. In order to understand presented data, it is desirable to display not only the information itself, but also the relations between visualized entities and other, more detailed information, that will simplify orientation in the created timeline. As many of such information can be obtained from automatic sources, the amount of displayed data can be quite large and it is necessary to find a ways how to facilitate the navigation in the visualized data set. We present a method based on the PageRank evaluation of importance of each visualized entity, along with the tagging that allow user to specify which topics are interested to him. We describe the way how the weight of each entity is calculated and how is the whole visualization created. Along with this, we also present a small user study that we performed to validate our approach.

Title: Virtual teams and conflicts: The role of Action Research

Abstract: Recent research shows that although virtual teams have risen in popularity especially in the area of IS development they are typically more conflictual than face-to-face teams. This is because team members are more unlikely to change their initial personal points of view through discussion when interacting with others virtually. If virtual teams are to succeed the issue of increased conflicts should be addressed. In this paper we use an approach known as Action Research as a means of creating shared understanding within a synchronous virtual team and ameliorating the effects of conflicts. We describe field research conducted between two institutions (in the US and UK) that were separated by several thousand miles and all participants connected from individual locations using virtual synchronous ICT. The study provided insight into the use of soft AR as an alternative approach to conflict resolution in virtual teams.

Title: Multi-sensor robotic-wheelchair controller for handicap and quadriplegia patients using embedded technologies

Abstract: Nowadays, there is a significant increase in the number of older persons in all countries of the world. This segment of society, as well as patients with quadriplegia and amputee's hands, lost the ability to use their arms to control traditional wheelchair which is controlled by Joystick. They need to use special control systems to control robotic-wheelchairs. In this paper, the design and development of a multi-input control system for rehabilitation application are proposed. The multi-input makes the system more flexible to adapt to the available body signals which are used as a control signal for the intelligent application. The first input is a voice controller unit. It consists of two voice recognition modules. Each module has a different algorithm for voice processing. The two modules have been combined into one unit and work parallel to enhance the voice recognition accuracy and reduce the voice recognition errors. The second input is the head orientation control unit. It uses the user head movement around x, y and z-axes to control the wheelchair movements in all directions. It includes two orientation modules, each one having three MEMS sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer) combined to get accurate orientation in the form of Euler angles. The head tilts controller includes an auto-calibrated algorithm that calibrates the head orientation in case of non-straight roads. The system is flexible to change between the two controllers depending on user requirements.

Title: A method for collision detection using mobile devices

Abstract: From April 2018, all cars and light vans sold in the European Union are to have a built-in eCall system. Its task will be automatic detection of accidents and informing the emergency services. The system will be installed in new cars. The installation in older vehicles may be difficult or uneconomical. This article presents the concept of a system executing similar tasks using a mobile device. A smartphone can be used to automatically send information about the collision, but also enables automatic voice connection. This can make it possible/easier for victims to call for help. The proposed system can also perform the function of the “black box” recording information on a moving vehicle before the collision. In the proposed solution it is also possible to set up an emergency number. Instead of emergency services, relatives can be notified and, if necessary, they can notify rescuers. The article presents the results of measurements recorded using mobile device sensors which allows an algorithm to be developed that recognizes collisions and an experimental implementation of the proposed system. The collision detection method and its implementation presented in this paper use an improved motion type recognition method developed by the authors. The motion type recognition method is used to reduce the risk of a false collision detection. The method is also briefly discussed.

Title: An online gait planner of hexapod robot to safely pass through crowded environment based on tactile sense and virtual dynamic model

Abstract: A major problem for a mobile robot aiming to work with people is how to move safely in a crowded environment where the robot-human contact is inevitable. However, most existing solutions focus on finding a collision-free path. Moreover, few of them considers the legged robots, which are believed to find wide applications in human daily life due to their superior mobility in complex artificial environments. In this paper, we propose a novel tactile-based gait planning method for a hexapod robot to pass through crowds in a safe and stable manner. Firstly, we developed a body trajectory generator based on a virtual dynamic model with actual contact force feedback. Then, we developed a leg trajectory planner by taking into account the ZMP stability criterion. In such a way, the contact force can be actively controlled and the stable tripod walking can be realized. We verify our method in simulations and then implement it on the real robot, HexbotIII, for experiments. The experimental results show that with our method the robot can effectively bypass moving humans while regulating the contact force in a safe range.

Title: Introducing the effect of aging into the Honey Bee Mating Optimization to determine parameters for blood glucose level calculation

Abstract: Diabetes mellitus is one of the most frequent civilization diseases. It is characterized with elevated blood glucose level. Elevated blood glucose level damages multiple organs with an increased risk of death, mainly due to hypo- or hyperglycemic shock. Eventually, diabetic patient becomes dependent on insulin to maintain normal blood glucose level. Over-dosage of insulin can lead to death in a short period. Therefore, patient and his physician must be aware of patient's blood glucose level. Patient does sporadic measuring of blood glucose level using a finger-stick. From time to time, the patient additionally wears a continuous glucose monitoring system. Such a system measures glucose level in subcutaneous tissue - it does not measure blood glucose level. As these two glucose levels are not necessarily the same, a model of glucose dynamics is needed to calculate blood glucose level from subcutaneous tissue glucose level. In this paper, we present a modification of the Honey Bee Mating Optimization algorithm to determine parameters of glucose-dynamics model. The proposed modification introduces effect of aging into the mating process. We demonstrate that aging improves parameter determination, especially when escaping local extreme of a fitness function.

Title: Distributed flocking with biconnected topology for multi-agent systems

Abstract: This paper studies the fault-tolerant cooperative control problem of agent groups in the context of multi-agent flocking tasks with second order linear dynamics. A distributed flocking algorithm with biconnected topology is proposed which is composed of two parts: motion strategy of biconnectivity and fault-tolerant flocking algorithm with bounded control input. The proposed algorithm handles the movement and reconfiguration of the flock, while maintaining the desired shape. It is proved that the proposed control algorithm can not only achieve the resultant biconnected network which is able to tolerate temporary node failures, but also guarantee the stable flocking motion. Several simulations are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the theoretical results.

Title: High-precision telerobot with human-centered variable perspective and scalable gestural interface

Abstract: Telerobotics (i.e., remote-controlling robots) is highly attractive for tasks in potentially dangerous situations, e.g., search and rescue, space exploration, and handling hazardous materials. However, when telerobots are deployed to complete tasks, the human operator needs to develop task plan and figure out how to execute it using the available control interface. Inappropriate controls can lead to excessive cognitive load and long task completion times. If the human operator can interact with the robot in an intuitive way, he or she can focus more on the task. For that reason, we have designed a human-centered control interface that allows the operator to modify the user perspective, command via hand gestures and natural language, and scale human input motion to any suitable range on the robot. The interface consists of a Leap Motion Controller for hand tracking, microphone for speech detection, and a simple turn knob for varying the scaling factor between the human and robot motions. The teleoperator software utilizes the Robot Operating System (ROS) which enables open-source development and hardware agnosticism. In this paper we demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed system by executing a high-precision task of threading a needle. Furthermore, we present results from a usability study in where people were asked to complete high-precision tasks with both the developed human-centered gestural control input and a conventional functionality-centered drag-and-drop interface.

Title: Human-Mobile Robot Interaction in laboratories using Kinect Sensor and ELM based face feature recognition

Abstract: In this paper, a new human feature based method is proposed for the intelligent HMRI (Human-Mobile Robot Interaction) in the indoor life science laboratories. The proposed method includes the contents as: (a) the Microsoft Kinect Sensors equipped on the mobile robots are adopted to detect the human and measure their face color images; (b) the different face features in the measured face images are defined to recognize the dynamic human face orientations. To find the best one among the available features, their comparison is provided, including the eyebrow zone, the eye zone, the hybrid eyebrow-eye zone and the nose zone; (c) the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is built to complete the intelligent computation for the robust recognition of the face orientations; and (d) based on the recognizing results of the face orientations, the human face moving directions are obtained successfully. Since the proposed HMRI strategy is developed for the real-time mobile robot based transportation, the computational accuracy and the real-time performance are both focused in this study. The experimental results indicate that the nose feature based HMRI strategy has the best performance, which can reach the success rate of 99.89% only consuming 0.127s.

Title: Interact with robot: An efficient approach based on finite state machine and mouse gesture recognition

Abstract: Communication between human operators and robots is important. In this paper, two problems are addressed: (1) how a robot can change its behavior sequences in manipulation tasks with human intervention; (2) how a human operator can transfer information to a robot efficiently. We tackle the first problem by proposing a framework based on finite state machine to model the robot action sequences in manipulation tasks. The framework shows the way in which a robot slides its level of autonomy by considering the result of the transition action and the input of the human operator. The framework can be easily extended to include higher level of autonomy. To tackle the second problem, we proposed a method to encode human intentions into simple mouse gestures. With a discriminative classifier, the robot can recognize the mouse gesture drawn by the human operator and carry out the corresponding action. The classifier is based on PCA and has been tested on our data set collected from four volunteers with an average precision of 96.25%.

Title: Neural learning enhanced teleoperation control of robots with uncertainties

Abstract: For most teleoperation tasks, it is desired that the telerobot manipulator follows timely and precisely the reference motion set at the master side. However, the conventional control approach may not guarantee the desired performance when there are dynamic uncertainties, especially when there is a notable variation of the telerobot's payload. In this paper, a neural learning based compensation mechanism has been exploited to overcome the effect of the unknown payload as well as uncertainties associated with the telerobot model and the environment. Guaranteed transient performance has been theoretically established. The deterministic learning technique has been employed, such that the neural learned knowledge can be efficiently reused. We performed comparative experiments and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design techniques.

Title: Recognition of human-robot motion intentions by trajectory observation

Abstract: The intention of humans and autonomous robots to interact in shared spatial areas is a challenging field of research regarding human safety, system stability and performance of the system's behavior. In this paper the intention recognition between human and robot from the control point of view are addressed and the time schedule of the exchanged signals is discussed. After a description of the kinematic and geometric relations between human and robot a so-called “compass dial” with the relative velocities is presented from which suitable fuzzy control rules are derived. The computation of the collision times at intersections and possible avoidance strategies are further discussed. Computations based on simulated and experimental data show the applicability of the methods presented.

Title: Natural spoken instructions understanding for rescue robot navigation based on cascaded Conditional Random Fields

Abstract: This paper introduces a framework of using natural Chinese spoken instructions to navigate a robot at distance in the scenario of disaster rescues. A model of three layers of cascaded Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) is proposed to process the instructions, which outputs a series of structured commands that are called Continuous Movements (CMs) of robot. 12-type Navigation Part of Speech (NPOS) is defined and tagged through the first layer of CRFs, and the sequence of NPOS tagging is used as the main features (or observed sequence) for the other two layers of CRFs. Feature selection is critical to the degree of accuracy of the model; experiments with the text corpus we collected in our laboratory, and the results are analyzed with respect to the consideration of features selected. The overall rate of correctly understanding the instructions in our experiment is 70.79% which is still not acceptable in practical use where a confirmation dialog with the operator is needed. The demonstration of this frame is quite well in our lab experiments of navigating a Pioneer 3-AT robot.

Title: Interactive collision avoidance system for indoor mobile robots based on human-robot interaction

Abstract: This paper presents a collision avoidance system based on human-robot interaction for mobile robots, which are working alongside to humans. In the future work environments, mobile robots will work side by side to humans. This raises big challenges related to the safety of the human and the ability of the robot to identify the people, interact with them and avoid physical accidents to them. To realize these concepts, a human-robot interaction system together with a collision avoidance system are developed to enable a safe navigation of the mobile robots. In this system, when a robot meets people in its path, it will try to interact with the human to execute one of the three actions: move forward, move backward, and collision avoidance; or the robot will implement the collision-avoidance autonomously when no people interacted with it. The interaction is based on the gestures obtained from the Kinect 2.0 sensor, and the system was tested using a H20 Robot (Canada). The experimental results proved the validity of the proposed system in interacting with the humans, and avoiding them.

Title: Experiments with automated evaluation of domain usability

Abstract: Many software systems nowadays aim for usability or accessibility from the effectiveness and ergonomics point of view. However, there still is lack of such ones that correctly use the domain dictionary, correctly describe domain relations and properties and implement the target domain processes via their user interfaces. This property is called `domain usability'. In this paper we describe the state of the art work and experiments in automating evaluation of domain usability. We designed and implemented multiple methods for evaluating some of the properties of domain usability via ontologies. As an implementation of the evaluation method, we present the DEAL tool for analysis of Java user interfaces with the new ADUE module and describe experiments performed with this tool.

Title: Multi-display work environment in the pharmacy domain

Abstract: Multi-display environments (MDE) are replacing single-display environments (SDE) to increase productivity of users. Although, little research of MDEs was conducted in domains of limited use of computer system. One such domain is pharmacy, in which computer systems are used by pharmacists to effect payment, search for medicines and offering services to patients. In this preliminary study we conducted a field experiment with the help of a domain expert evaluating the use of SDE and MDE in a Slovak pharmacy setting. The experiment was evaluated objectively and subjectively. Objective measures consist of window active time (WAT), workload on program windows and frequency of switching between windows. The measured data showed, that MDE in pharmacy domain positively affects the pharmacist work experience and has effect on his/her work, although the measuring effect of MDE on his/her productivity stays a challenge for the future work.

Title: Differentiating horse walk and trot on the basis of inertial motion capture

Abstract: This article describes a method for differentiating two types of horse gaits: walk and trot. Recognition of gait types is significant for different research branches. It is important in animal behavior analysis, gait and stride timing analysis, lameness detection, sports such as horse trotting and identifying opportunities for the use of horses. Research described in this article concerns detection of horse gait type on the basis of acceleration measurement with the use of inertial motion capture system. Two 6 DoF motion trackers were used for recording vertical acceleration of a horse trunk at the withers and at the lumbo-sacral junction. Developed method for gait type differentiation uses discrete Fourier transform and the analysis of local maximums of Fourier magnitude spectrum with LDA. Presented research results shows that it is possible to distinguish between two gait types mentioned above in automatic manner.

Title: Investigations of double layer UV-curing resin diamond wire saw

Abstract: In view of poor resin flexibility and easy to fall off of diamond grits during manufacturing process of single layer UV-curing resin diamond wire saw, a novel manufacturing approach of double layer UV-curing resin diamond wire saw is put forward. During the manufacturing process, a layer of UV-curing resin with a good pliability and strong binding ability is uniformly coated on the core wire surface, then it is cured by the UV light. After that, a layer of UV-curing resin containing diamond grits is coated on the wire surface coated with resin. Another curing is conducted by the UV light. Then the double layer UV-curing resin diamond wire saw is manufactured. The cutting experiments of single and double layer UV-curing resin diamond wire saw are performed for silicon ingot at a single wire sawing machine.

Title: Tele-operator performance and their perception of system time lags when completing mobile robot tasks

Abstract: Effects of motion lag on the capability of a tele-operated mobile-robot operator are investigated. Lags can occur through communication delays as tele-operated mobile robots work at a distance or because of a lack of parallel computing power as robots are enhanced with additional systems. This work concentrates on time lag in a tele-operated mobile robot system and investigates when a mobile robot operator might begin to perceive a lag in the movement of a mobile robot. A threshold of permissible lag is established for mobile robot operators that relates to the maximum time lag before an operator noticed a lag.

Title: A classification and comparison of usability evaluation methods for interactive adaptive systems

Abstract: Usability is a crucial factor for interactive adaptive system success. Several methods have been proposed to support the usability evaluation of interactive adaptive systems. However, the diversity of these methods leaves the evaluators wondering what would be the most appropriate usability evaluation methods for their specific goals. This paper examines the characteristics of usability evaluation methods for interactive adaptive systems and identifies the most relevant features for categorizing them. The comparison and classification of these methods will serve as a reference for researchers in the field of interactive adaptive systems and as a guide for the choice of suitable usability evaluation methods.

Title: Garment level power distribution for wearables using inductive power transfer

Abstract: Wearable and smart devices are gaining in popularity, with many users now using multiple devices. Each of these devices requires individual charging and power maintenance. This paper proposes power sharing between multiple wearables to alleviate some of the burden of charging multiple devices. To achieve wearable and smart device power sharing, we propose using the garments we wear as a power distribution backbone. To allow non-contact power transfer between garments, bi-directional inductive power transfer is used. We demonstrate a novel coil topology called Feed Coils constructed from flexible materials to aid garment integration and user comfort. Our system complies with international guidelines on time-varying magnetic field exposure to human tissue, allowing the system to be operated in close proximity to the body. Three preliminary experiments are conducted to characterize the bi-directional inductive power sharing system and to investigate the feasibility and human factors impacting wearable and smart device power sharing.

Title: Data fusion-based real-time hand gesture recognition with Kinect V2

Abstract: Hand gesture recognition is an important topic in human-computer interaction. However, most of the current methods are complicated and time-consuming, which limits the use of hand gesture recognition in real-time circumstances. In this paper, we propose a data fusion-based hand gesture recognition model by fusing depth information and skeleton data. Because of the accurate segmentation and tracking with Kinect V2, the model can achieve real-time performance, which is 18.7% faster than some of the state-of-the-art methods. Based on the experimental results, the proposed model is accurate and robust to rotation, flip, scale changes, lighting changes, cluttered background, and distortions. This ensures its use in different real-world human-computer interaction tasks.

Title: Multi-use high-technology testbed

Abstract: The efficient use of energy is one method of potentially reducing the amount of fossil fuels that are used world-wide to generate electricity. Nuclear energy presents a promising sustainable energy source for the future that generates few to no greenhouse gases. While it creates energy that can be used for electricity it also has many byproducts that are treated as waste or not utilized to their full potential. Waste heat is a major product of nuclear energy that should be harnessed and applied to other processes. These include water desalination/water purification hydrogen production, use in industrial chemical operations, or electricity production. Nuclear energy is most often base load following power and very inflexible. One way to address this is to use Hybrid Energy Systems (HES). By doing this the system can be load following and hence more efficient and sustainable. Therefore, the goal of this project is to create a system that mimics the waste heat from a reactor, demonstrate how to utilize that heat, and show that when energy demand is low the reactor does not need to reduce power; the energy can be directed elsewhere to create goods. This paper presents the details of the Energy Conversion Loop (ECL) that was developed to act as a test bed for experimentation of the aforementioned processes and test the possibility of nuclear HES. Further, the paper presents a proposed intelligent control system that can adapt to the system requirements for the ECL. In addition, the system has great potential for education on critical infrastructure protection and testing of future control logic systems and mechanical systems.

Title: Remote aircraft composite inspection using 3D imaging

Abstract: The problem stated is there is no reliable in-service inspection method that quickly and easily detects the composite material damage. The aerospace industry needs to make efficient use of the inspections to turn the aircraft around in an efficient timeframe. This paper discusses the methodology for semi-automatic visualization of the process of inspecting composite materials for damage. The research is focused on the application of inspection of composite damage in aircrafts using Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR). Two configurations using the LIDAR is discussed in determining damage to an aircraft. The configurations are derived from several studies using smaller aircraft parts and a small autonomous RMax helicopter. This study helps provide a solution for a quick turnaround and an efficient scan of the possible composite damage in aircraft. The four primary objectives are: Objective 1: Determine whether semi-automated three-dimensional visualization composite inspection techniques are as effective as experienced human inspectors in locating potential composite damage. Objective 2: Determine whether data from several Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) cameras can be combined for use in conducting semi-automated three-dimensional visualization composite inspections. Objective 3: Determine whether LIDAR camera scans can be performed on a moving aircraft for use with semi-automated three-dimensional visualization composite inspections. Objective 4: Assess the important human factors contributors associated with interpreting the LIDAR camera scan data.

Title: Designing interface and integration framework for multi-channels intelligent surveillance system

Abstract: This paper addresses design and implementation of a multi-channels intelligent surveillance system (ISS). The system is developed for handling multiple source data from four different camera networks. It processes the incoming frames simultaneously using a multi-threading strategy and automatically detect any suspicious event on the monitoring area. Different with the existing commercial systems, the ISS covers several different surveillance tasks in ensuring a public safety such as unattended object detection, fire and smoke detection, human detection and tracking, sterile zone monitoring, and illegally parked vehicle detection. Each individual task is implemented separately using advanced image processing and pattern recognition algorithms. The system combines these all surveillance tasks considering not only a high accuracy, but also a fast processing time.

Title: A pipeline using multi-layer Tumors Automata for interactive multi-label image segmentation

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a novel algorithm to the problem of interactive image segmentation. We propose an extension of the Growcut framework using the Tumors Automata (TA) formed from the superpixel. The proposed TA is similar to Cellular Automata but can directly deal with superpixel. The superpixels (image segments) can provide powerful boundary cues to guide segmentation, where superpixels can be collected easily by over-segmenting the image using any reasonable existing segmentation algorithms. Given a small number of user-labelled superpixels, the rest of the image is segmented automatically by a TA. When the automaton labels the image, the segmentation evolution is faster than Growcut because of the iterative process. Moreover, a level set method and multi-layer TA are employed to further improve the performance. Experiments conducted on the Berkeley Segmentation Database demonstrate the superior performance of our method over the state-of-the-art methods.

Title: The rigid body gap filling algorithm

Abstract: Using an optical passive motion capture system, researchers encounter problems involving marker occlusion. A marker can be covered during motion. This loss of information may cause various problems. For example, the output values of a biomechanical model (such as forces, moments etc.) cannot be computed or are incomplete in recording fragments in which markers are occluded. This paper presents a new, universal gap-filling algorithm for gaps in the trajectories of markers that belong to object segments which may be modelled (by approximation) as rigid bodies. It can fill in gaps in the trajectory of a marker which can be located at the beginning, at the end or in the middle of a recording. In order to assess the algorithm a series of automatic tests were conducted. A set of gapless files with real motion capture data post-processed by an expert was prepared. Then gaps of varying properties were artificially created in the test files. The gaps were filled using the proposed solution. The obtained results were compared to the original files prepared by the expert. The test dataset contains files with three types of movements representing different motion dynamics. The quality of the presented method was assessed for three body segments (head, torso and pelvic) and for three relative generated gap lengths (10%, 20% and 30%). 840 tests with artificially created missing markers were performed. Errors were highest for the torso segment and lowest for the head segment.

Title: Construction of neural nets in brain-computer interface for robot arm steering

Abstract: The paper presents an attempt to construct a direct brain-to-machine interface (BCI) that could be used to control movements of a robotic arm. A series of experiments was performed to collect data from subjects, train and validate an effective neural network and search for a generalized solution. The ERD/ERS imagery paradigm was chosen to extract valid data from the EEG signal. Since categorizing between two opposite states (like Left-Right) proved to be the most reliable, a control structure containing multiple neural networks was proposed. New research concerns the method of development and the use of neural networks classifiers. An automated procedure was used to select the best bipolar classifiers from the set of machine-generated neural networks. The chosen classifiers were used in a hierarchical structure responsible for signal interpretation. Adoption of this method was motivated mainly by the complexity of arm movement. The movement consisted of several phases, such as the initiation, continuation, change of direction, change of speed. It was observed that simple bipolar classifiers produced better output than classifiers designed to recognize complex decisions.

Title: Stairways detection and distance estimation approach based on three connected point and triangular similarity

Abstract: Detecting stair region and estimating the distance from a camera to stair in a stair image is the fundamental step in the implementation of autonomous stair climbing navigation, as well as alarm systems for vision impaired people. In this paper, a framework is proposed for detecting the stair region from stair image utilizing some natural properties of stair. One unique property of them is, every stair step's beginning and ending horizontal edge point intersects with two vertical edge points creating three connected point. These vertical edges are stair step's height and its width edge. Another unique property is steps of a stair appear gradually increasing order from top to bottom of the stair in a parallel arrangement. For that initially, directional Gabor filter and Canny edge detector are employed on the stair image to eliminate the influence of illumination and for detecting stair edges. Non-candidate stair edges are removed by performing filtering operation. Then longest horizontal edges are extracted by using a proposed edge linking method on the edge image. After that, a search method is applied for finding stair step height and width edge point at the beginning and ending point of the longest horizontal edges. This operation is performed for detecting three connected points to validate the stair edges. In the next step, increasing longest horizontal edge segments are extracted by comparing x coordinate values of two consecutive edges end points to justify them as stair edges. Finally, from this set of horizontal edges, vanishing point is calculated to verify stair edges from other similar patterns and confirm the detection of stair candidate region. In addition, the triangular similarity is used for distance estimation from camera to stair. The proposed framework is tested using various stair images under a variety of conditions and results are presented to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness.

Title: Robust Photometric Stereo in a scattering medium via Low-Rank Matrix Completion and Recovery

Abstract: Photometric Stereo is a popular method for 3D reconstruction from images due to its high level of details handling. However, when it is used in a scattering medium such as lakes and oceans, the recovery result will be negatively impacted by the light absorption, light scattering and the impurities in the water. In this paper, we present a new method to solve the problem of better 3D reconstruction via Low-Rank Matrix Completion and Recovery. First, we use the dark points, like shadows and darkness in the water to fit the scattering effect distribution and then remove the scattering from the image. Next, we use the Robust Principal Component Analysis method (RPCA) to recover the image by removing the sparse noise including shadows, impurities and some corrupted points caused by backscatter compensation. Finally, we combine the RPCA results and the least-squares (LS) results to get the surface normal and accomplish the 3D reconstruction. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves more accurate estimates of surface normal and 3D reconstruction than previous techniques.

Title: EEG feature selection for thought driven robots using evolutionary Algorithms

Abstract: Machine control using electroencephalography (EEG) based brain computer interfaces (BCI) has been extensively researched in the past decade. However, research is often based on event bound methods such as motor imagery. Despite being useful in medical applications, even bound methods limit users' operational capability while performing BCI control. To alleviate the said limitation, we explore a robot control framework based on abstract thought. Abstract thought in this context is defined as conscious mental tasks that are not bound with any particular event or bodily movement. This paper presents an initial step in the framework, which is a methodology for optimal feature selection for abstract thought EEG data classification. The presented method contains 2 steps: 1) generational Genetic Algorithm (GA) based feature selection, and, 2) EEG data classification using selected features. The presented method was implemented on an EEG dataset acquired from a consumer grade EEG device. Abstract thought EEG data were collected for three actions pertaining to robot control; 1) “rest”, 2) “move forward”, and, 3) “turn left”. The presented method was compared to EEG classification without any feature selection. Experimental results showed that the presented method outperformed the method without feature selection for all the tested classifiers with a 10% or higher improvement in classification accuracy.

Title: Radial photic stimulation for maximal EEG response for BCI applications

Abstract: This study proposes the use of radial visual stimuli design to obtain increased steady state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) responses that can be utilised in brain-computer interfaces (BCI). Visual stimuli designs based on chip on board (COB) LEDs were used in this study to compare the influences of the radial with horizontal and concentric patterns in SSVEP. Circular rings with diameters 70 mm, 90 mm, 110 mm, and 130 mm with green COB LEDs were used for radial and concentric patterns while green strip COB LED of 18 mm width and length 16 cm was used for horizontal pattern. The visual flicker and the concentric patterns were generated and controlled precisely by a 32-bit microcontroller platform. The SSVEP frequencies used were 7, 8, 9 and 10 Hz for a period of 30 seconds for each horizontal, radial and concentric circle visual stimulus. The study analysed the EEG recording from five participants comprising of five trials from each frequency and three different stimuli designs to identify the most responsive visual stimulus for evoking SSVEP. Furthermore, we also compared the influence of ring diameters in radial visual stimulus to identify the maximal response and minimal visual fatigue. The results indicated that radial stimulus gave significantly better response than concentric circles or horizontal stimuli for all the participants. Also 130 mm radial stimulus gave the highest response and viewing comfort.

Title: A hapto-tactile display for presenting virtual objects in human-scale tactual search

Abstract: In the recognition of an object situated in front of us, we firstly watch it and then try to touch it to feel the tactile and haptic sensation to be perceived by our hands. Various virtual reality and augmented reality systems have been introduced with the growing computational powers, however visual and auditory information related with a virtual object is mainly presented simultaneously to a user for enhancing the reality. If we consider the real situation of a user to try to recognize an object in the living environment, tactile and haptic information is assumed to be rather important for the better interaction with the object. In this study, we develop a hapto-tactile display that covers the movable range of a human arm in the tactual search for presenting tactile sensation of a virtual object. We design and construct a tactile pad to be fixed at the tip of a passively-driven haptic arm, and the tactile sensation and haptic force are simultaneously displayed to a user wearing the pad in the hand. The development of the hapto-tactile display for human tactile search will be described in this paper, together with an experiment to verify the validity of the system.

Title: An analysis of EEG signal combined with pupillary response in the dynamics of human cognitive processing

Abstract: The paper presents a combined analysis of electroencephalographic data and additional biomedical data: pupil diameter and blink features. A case study was performed with a specially designed experiment causing human cognitive effort to alternate with a relaxation break. The aim of the paper is to check the hypothesis that traditional EEG-based cognitive workload analysis might be supported with additional biomedical data such as pupil dilation, blink rate, blink interval and blink closure duration indicating human cognitive effort.

Title: Building facade detection using geometric planar constraints

Abstract: This paper describes the approach for detecting the building facade using geometric constrain. A planar building facade is only considered. Most of the building facade has the form of a rectangle, which is produced by two or more vertical and horizontal lines, which are orthogonal to each other on the building. The parallel lines in the 3D space are projected onto lines in the image plane that are grouped along the direction of vanishing points. Line segments are extracted from an image for estimating vanishing points. In order to cluster the line segments corresponding to respective a hypothesized vanishing point, J-linkage algorithm is used for simultaneous estimation of multiple models. After clustering the line segments, vanishing point is estimated by minimizing error between vanishing point and line segments of an image. Building facade is detected by using the relationship between vertical and horizontal vanishing points. Building has a cubic structure with two perpendicular planes, which meet at a line. The intersection points between two horizontal vanishing points are located on the intersection line of two facades. Finally, building facades are extracted by the geometric relationships between vertical vanishing point corresponding to respective horizontal vanishing point.

Title: Automatic rehabilitation of the Extension Lag using the developed knee assistive instrument

Abstract: Patients with Extension Lag cannot extend their knee straightly single-handedly. However, they can extend their knee without pain, if the other (a physical therapist (PT)) stretch the knee. The recovery of the Extension Lag is not necessary surgery, and is often enough only to perform rehabilitation. However, the rehabilitation of the Extension Lag is hard work for the PTs. This paper proposes the control algorithm for the automatic rehabilitation of the Extension Lag by adapting the Knee Assistive Instruments for Rehabilitation (KAI-R) that has been developed for the walking rehabilitation after the surgery of the Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) in order to reduce the load of the PT. The safety and the effectiveness of the robot are necessary to be verified, because we are going to adopt the robot to a clinical trial. First, the validity of the motion of the robot that is installed the control algorithm is confirmed by the high speed movie camera. Secondly, the effectiveness is investigated by using surface myoelectric potential. Thirdly, the motion of the robot is confirmed by the doctor and the PTs. It is clear that the robot for the rehabilitation of the Extension Lag can be adopted to a clinical trial.

Title: Comparison of selected off-the-shelf solutions for emotion recognition based on facial expressions

Abstract: The paper concerns accuracy of emotion recognition from facial expressions. As there are a couple of ready off-the-shelf solutions available in the market today, this study aims at practical evaluation of selected solutions in order to provide some insight into what potential buyers might expect. Two solutions were compared: FaceReader by Noldus and Xpress Engine by QuantumLab. The performed evaluation revealed that the recognition accuracies differ for photo and video input data and therefore solutions should be matched to the specificity of the application domain.

Title: Pedestrian detection and tracking of a mobile robot with multiple 2D laser range scanners

Abstract: This paper proposes a method for detecting and tracking pedestrians, which is an important function for preventing the collision of autonomously moving mobile robots with a pedestrian. To observe the pedestrian, we use two types of laser range scanners: one scans a 2D plane (2D scanner) and the other scans a 3D space, such as a 3D scanner. We scan 3D space with a 2D scanner fixed on the turning mechanism, instead of a 3D scanner, because 3D scanners are more expensive than 2D scanners. The 3D space is divided into voxels to determine whether a pedestrian exists. This detection system is robust to occlusion because turning 3D scanner can detect a pedestrian based on the shape of the data points. However, the scanning span of the turning 3D scanner depends on the period of the turning mechanism; thus, we combine the detected pedestrian's position with the data scanned by the normal 2D scanner because it is possible for a 2D scanner to track objects moving in real time according to the positional transition of the data points. To investigate the efficiency of the proposed method for pedestrian detection, which is robust to occlusion and exhibits real-time tracking using reasonable scanning devices, we experiment with our prototype.

Title: Investigation of brain activation with body schema induced by TENS using NIRS

Abstract: The body schema is a brain function to grasp own body location spatially. When a person uses tools or manipulates machines, the body schema is modified unconsciously, and he/she perceives these tools or machines as a part of his/her own body. In this study, brain activation adapting the strength of the body schema modification was investigated, and the possibility to interfere the body schema by electrical stimulus was confirmed. A tracing task (in which the participant traced characters using own hand with a stick) was designed, and the electrical stimulus was provided to the participant during the tracing task. And, cerebral blood flow was measured using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) simultaneously and was analyzed. The brain activation under several conditions (the strength of the body schema modification and the strength of the electrical stimulus) was investigated using the paired t-test. The results showed that the inferior parietal lobule and the occipital lobe were significantly activated (t(8) = 1.860, p

Title: Real-time 3D point cloud segmentation using Growing Neural Gas with Utility

Abstract: This paper proposes a real-time feature extraction and segmentation method for a 3D point cloud. First of all, we apply Growing Neural Gas with Utility (GNG-U) to the point cloud for learning a topological structure. However, the standard GNG-U cannot learn the topological structure of 3D space environment and color information simultaneously. To this end, we then modify the GNG-U algorithm by using a weight vector. we propose a surface feature extraction and segmentation method by efficiently utilizing the topological structure. Our segmentation method is based on a region growing method whose similarity value uses the inner value of two normal vectors connected by the topological structure. We show experimental results of the proposed method and discuss the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Title: Social rhythm management support system based on Informationally Structured Space

Abstract: Recently, the number of elderly people living alone is increasing and has become a serious problem in Japan. On the other hand, the stability of both social rhythm and biological rhythm is very important for extension of healthy life expectancy. It is difficult for elderly people to understand the current stability of social rhythm and biological rhythm in daily life. Therefore, we propose several visualization and management systems based on daily life monitoring. First, we explain a measurement method of human daily life logs. Next, we show a social rhythm management support system based on three different types of classification methods, such as (1) ICF (International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health), (2) NHK (Nippon Hoso Kyokai) Activity classification, and (3) Social Rhythm Metric (SRM). Finally, we discuss the effectiveness of the proposed methods and future works.

Title: Robust lane marking detection based on multi-feature fusion

Abstract: In the field of intelligent vehicle systems (IVS), color and edge of lane markings are important features for vision-based applications. This paper proposes a method to detect lane marking based on a fusion approach which combine color and edge lane marking information. Firstly, by knowing the vehicle speed the road surface region of interest is extracted using the typical stopping distance. Secondly, a lane marking clustering method is introduced. This is done by combining the edge and color information of the lane marking. Finally, a fitting model is implemented. A line fitting model is used to extract the lane marking parameters. However for those regions in which lane can not described as a line, the algorithm computed the curve parameters using Lagrange interpolating polynomial.

Title: Visual impression to robot motion imitating human - study on delay motion

Abstract: This paper considers the visual impression in a human robot interaction where a robot imitates the human motion obtained by Microsoft Kinect. In this interaction, a subject swings both arms up and down while Kinect measures the subject's motion and this motion is sent to the robot with a certain delay time. In the above situation, firstly, this paper quantitatively shows the perceptible delay time for a human when the robot motion is delayed with respect to own motion. Next, this paper investigates human impressions when he/she watches the robot motion being not synchronized to his/her motion. Last, the difference of the impressions to the delay and synchronic robot motion is statistically verified.

Title: The evaluation of eGlasses eye tracking module as an extension for Scratch

Abstract: In this paper we present the possibility of using eGlasses eye tracking module as an extension for Scratch programming tool which is a visual programming language supporting computer skills learning. The main concept behind this project is to setup the interface for rapid interaction design. Eye tracking is a powerful tool for hands free communication but for that requires a dedicated software. This software is rarely tailored for a specific needs of a potential user. It means that people who wants to explore gaze driven computer interfaces often need to create their own eye tracking software or need to have certain computer skills to be able to go through the software development kit (SDK) provided by the eye tracker vendors. It makes designing interaction by gaze quite challenging. The eGlasses eye tracking module was used to extend sensor values available in Scratch by the information about pupil position, gaze position and eye opened/eye closed signal. In this paper we have tested if the gaze data acquired by the eGlasses are reliable and can be used as an input signal for rapid interaction design using Scratch. The whole interface was validated regarding the system usability score (SUS). The purpose of our work is to support disabled children and their therapists but also to give a chance to a wider community, without computational skills, to easily check they ideas for gaze based interaction. The results of conducted studies with the participation of volunteers give strong foundations to support this statement.

Title: Shopping behaviour analysis using eyetracking and EEG

Abstract: This article presents a study of customer behaviour during the selection of products from the store shelf. There are many factors that can determine whether a particular product attracts shoppers' attention, such as shape and colour of the packaging, location on the shelf, price and brand. During this study we have created a store shelf with groceries that resembled a real life shopping experience. Furthermore, we have used eyetracking glasses and Emotiv EEG to record participants gaze and emotions during the process of shopping. We have analysed the behaviour of 14 participants (both men and women), and recognised how valuable is the addition of EEG device to such eyetracking study. Moreover, the usage of EEG enabled us to analyse basic emotions, i.e. to find factors that were frustrating for participants and could be improved in real life shops.

Title: Application of thermal imaging camera in eye tracking evaluation

Abstract: This paper presents a method for applying a thermal imaging camera to enhance eyetracking usability testing. The first part of the article introduces the eye tracking, one of the most popular usability evaluation method. Eyetracking records the position of participants' gaze on the screen with a dedicated camera. Eyetracking is a very efficient usability testing method. It allows determining which elements of user interface attract users' attention and which are not noticed by them. The second part of the article focuses on thermal imaging camera. Some theoretical background is provided on how such cameras work. Furthermore, paper contains instructions on how to conduct usability testing using eyetracker and the infrared camera, as well as a description of a case study - evaluation of SimplyTick web application. The proposed method allows researchers to enhance the standard eye tracking test with recording of thermal image of the participant's face, from which it is possible to recognize emotions during the course of the study. This enables us to obtain an extra measure of usability associated with emotions and user satisfaction.

Title: Estimation of the amplitude of the signal for the active optical gesture sensor with sparse detectors

Abstract: In this paper we deal with the problem of precise gesture recognition for the active optical proximity sensor with sparse 8 photodiodes. We particularly focus on developing the method of estimating the real, usually not observable, maximum signal value representing maximum intensity of light reflected from an obstacle present in the front of the sensor. Different configurations of the fingers were used as an obstacle. The Monte Carlo simulations were performed in order to cognize the accurate pattern created by fingers of considered configurations. The accurate description of curves representing finger profiles was obtained after applying the least squares method. The results of analyzes proved that finger arrangement configurations, particularly 1 finger and 2 jointed fingers, can be considered as sources of Gaussian like shapes on the face of the sensor. Therefore, data measured by 8 sparse photodiodes of the active optical gesture sensor were compared to normal distribution curves. The results of the comparison allow normalization of the measured data and the estimation of the real, usually not observable, maximum signal value. The results and discussion sections of the paper present the average detection accuracy, advantages and limitations of the proposed approach.

Title: Heat is in the eye of the beholder: Towards better authenticating on smartglasses

Abstract: Smart and wearable devices are trendy electronic objects that have become increasingly popular in recent years. Those devices are, by definition, tightly connected with the user's personal activities. Authentication is therefore a critical feature for both identifying users and personalizing the services on the device. In particular, the emergence of smartglasses changed the way we thought a wearable could assist users in their daily activities. As designed by commercial providers, smartglasses are sold with a very specific set of interactions capabilities. These capabilities have a strong impact on how comfortably or safely users may authenticate to their smartglasses. For this reason, we investigate in this paper the different authentication methods available for smartphones and we comparatively position the smartglasses in the design space of authentication methods. We propose a new approach based on touch input on an arbitrary surface using thermal camera input. This approach aims to circumvent the lack of touch surface provided by smartglasses, while maintaining an acceptable level of security.

Title: EMG and gaze based interaction with graphic interface of smart glasses application

Abstract: In this paper we investigate the effectiveness of the interaction using eye tracking and electromyography. Smart glasses requires reliable interfaces for controlling the graphic content displayed directly in front of the user's eye. Presented research is related with the eGlasses project, which is focused on the development of an open platform in the form of multisensory electronic glasses and related interaction methods. One of the implemented interaction methods is the one based on eye tracking module. The eye tracking provides quite accurate pointing but there is always a matter of how to select and confirm while using the eye tracking. In this paper we combine the eye tracking with the EMG signal acquired from the skeletal muscles. Both, the advantages and limitation of the method are discussed.

Title: The accuracy of pulse rate estimation from the sequence of face images

Abstract: The goal of this paper is to analyze the accuracy of pulse rate estimation from the sequence of face images. Simulated and real signals were used to evaluate two pulse rate estimators; one for frequency domain and the second one for time domain using the autocorrelation function. The results show that the mean difference between the reference measurements and estimated pulse rate values are about 2bpm. In the analysis of short signals the estimator working in time domain has better accuracy since it is not limited by spectral leakage observed in the analysis of spectrum for short length signals.

Title: Not a tile out of place: Toward creating context-dependent user interfaces on smartglasses

Abstract: Despite the rapid pace of gadgets released on the market, research in the area of usable interfaces for wearables is lagging behind. Smartglasses are new wearables that embed diverse sensors but also have small displays, and this makes it hard for the wearer to visualize real-time data. To bridge this gap, the contribution of this paper is threefold. First, we propose a data representation model to combine applications and services that match user activities and contexts. Second, we present an approach of showing relevant services to the user based on `tiles' (such as those in recent Microsoft Windows interfaces) while considering the device constraints. Finally, we suggest that combining those two aspects can open the way to personalized services for the end user, creating new ways of interacting with applications and devices.

Title: The data exchange between smart glasses and healthcare information systems using the HL7 FHIR standard

Abstract: In this study we evaluated system architecture for the use of smart glasses as a viewer of information, as a source of medical data (vital sign measurements: temperature, pulse rate, and respiration rate), and as a filter of healthcare information. All activities were based on patient/device identification procedures using graphical markers or features based on visual appearance. The architecture and particular use cases were implemented and verified using smart glasses prototypes developed under the eGlasses project and using a reference Health Level 7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (HL7 FHIR) server. The results show that information about the identified patient can be quickly retrieved from FHIR servers and annotated using voice recognition services. Smart glasses can be used in the measurement of vital signs of the observed patient, providing values of body temperature, pulse rate, and respiration rate by means of non-contact measurements. Such measurements are sufficiently reliable for medical screening and for fast data exchange using HL7 FHIR actions.

Title: Extending touch-less interaction with smart glasses by implementing EMG module

Abstract: In this paper we propose to use temporal muscle contraction to perform certain actions. Method: The set of muscle contractions corresponding to one of three actions including “single-click”, “double-click” “click-n-hold” and “non-action” were recorded. After recording certain amount of signals, the set of five parameters was calculated. These parameters served as an input matrix for the neural network. Two-layer feedforward neural network with one hidden layer of 200 neurons was applied to classify gestures based on the input matrix. Results: The network was trained using the dataset consisted of 43 samples and then tested on the 34 samples dataset. All gestures from the test set were correctly classified.

Title: Real-time facial feature tracking in poor quality thermal imagery

Abstract: Recently, facial feature tracking systems have become more and more popular because of many possible use cases. Especially in medical applications location of the face and facial features are very useful. Many researches have presented methods to detect and track facial features in visible light. However, facial feature analysis in thermography may also be very advantageous. Some examples of using infrared imagery in medicine include the estimation of the respiration rate using an analysis of temperature changes in the area below nose region. Moreover, due to technological development small thermal cameras may be embedded into wearable devices, like smart glasses and used to support remote patient monitoring. Therefore, in this paper, we focused on face tracking in low quality thermal images. Especially, we compared four interest points detectors for facial feature tracking in thermal images. All methods were tested for processing time, displacement of detected areas and errors of calculated mean value of pixel intensities in the detected nose region. Finally, we presented a fully automatic system for facial features tracking, which allows to process one frame in about 27.7ms (Harris), 23.9ms (ORB), 19.7ms (SIFT), 27.6ms (SURF) with acceptable accuracy (Harris - 7.2±4.3%, ORB 9.9±2.2%, SIFT 7.0±1.9%, SURF 8.9±2.7%).

Title: Using wearable device for biomedical signal acquisition and processing

Abstract: In this paper we present the research conducted on synchronous measurements of biosignals. The experiment was conducted to evaluate the possibility of estimating vital signs based on eye tracking. Method: The eGlasses platform was used for acquisition of ECG, respiration rate, eye and pupil movement and blood pressure. Data were acquired in three 5 min. intervals during which a subject was performing certain tasks. The signals were filtered and resampled. The correlation between blood pressure, respiration and pupil dilation was calculated. Results: The measurements were conducted on 12 healthy volunteers. The obtained correlation coefficient was similar for all people and measurement positions. Conclusions: The electronic eyewear like eGlasses can be utilized to measure and process essential vital signs. Although some results are promising, estimating a value of blood pressure or hart rate based on data provided by eye tracking module requires some further studies.

Title: Pose classification in the gesture recognition using the linear optical sensor

Abstract: Gesture sensors for mobile devices, which have a capability of distinguishing hand poses, require efficient and accurate classifiers in order to recognize gestures based on the sequences of primitives. Two methods of poses recognition for the optical linear sensor were proposed and validated. The Gaussian distribution fitting and Artificial Neural Network based methods represent two kinds of classification approaches. Three types of hand poses, differing in the number of fingers joined together, were investigated. The reflected light intensity pattern originated by hand located closely to the sensor was parameterized into 14 features. The change of reflection pattern originated by hand dislocation was reduced by application of two variable functions in the first of the methods. A one and two hidden layers topologies were considered in the neural network related approach. Both methods were designed with the use of a training set of samples and validated with another (testing) set. The results present the average poses recognition rate of 81.19% for Gaussian distribution fitting and 90.02% for ANN based method.

Title: Deep features class activation map for thermal face detection and tracking

Abstract: Recently, capabilities of many computer vision tasks have significantly improved due to advances in Convolutional Neural Networks. In our research, we demonstrate that it can be also used for face detection from low resolution thermal images, acquired with a portable camera. The physical size of the camera used in our research allows for embedding it in a wearable device or indoor remote monitoring solution for elderly and disabled people. The benefits of the proposed architecture were experimentally verified on the thermal video sequences, acquired in various scenarios to address possible limitations of remote diagnostics: movements of the person performing a diagnose and movements of the examined person. The achieved short processing time (42.05±0.21ms) along with high model accuracy (false positives -0.43%; true positives for the patient focused on a certain task -89.2%) clearly indicates that the current state of the art in the area of image classification and face tracking in thermography was significantly outperformed.

Title: Playback detection using machine learning with spectrogram features approach

Abstract: This paper presents 2D image processing approach to playback detection in automatic speaker verification (ASV) systems using spectrograms as speech signal representation. Three feature extraction and classification methods: histograms of oriented gradients (HOG) with support vector machines (SVM), HAAR wavelets with AdaBoost classifier and deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) were compared on different data partitions in respect of speakers or playback devices: for instance with different speakers in training and test subsets. The playback detection systems were trained and tested on two speech datasets S
1
 and S
2
 manufactured independently by two different institutions. The test error for both datasets oscillates about the level of 1% for HOG+SVM and even below it for CNN in bigger S
1
 base. In cross validation scenario in which one base was used for training and second base for the test the results were very poor what suggests that the information relevant for playback detection appeared in each base in different way.

Title: The role of EMG module in hybrid interface of prosthetic arm

Abstract: Nearly 10% of all upper limb amputations concern the whole arm. It affects the mobility and reduces the productivity of such a person. These two factors can be restored by using prosthetics. However, the complexity of human arm makes restoring its basic functions quite difficult. When the osseointegration and/or targeted muscle reinnervation (TMR) are not possible, different modalities can be used to control the prosthesis. In this paper the usability of electromyography (EMG) signals for such a control is evaluated. Method: first, the types of operations performed by the prosthetic arm that could be handled by EMG module were defined. The raw EMG signal, corresponding to the predefined gesture, was acquired from the surface of trapezius muscle. The pattern recognition neural network was trained to classify gestures based on recorded RAW data. Results: The neural network was trained using 56 signals corresponding to performed gestures. Optimal performance was achieved for 29 training cycles. The network was tested using data set of 56 gestures. The designed network was tested on gestures recorded from 10 volunteers. The gestures were correctly classified with nearly 84% accuracy. Conclusions: The EMG analysis is a reliable modality when it comes to hybrid interfaces for control over prosthetic arm.

Title: Baggage detection and classification using human body parameter & boosting technique

Abstract: Automatic Video Surveillance System (AVSS) has become important to computer vision researchers as crime in public places has increased in the twenty first century. As a new branch of AVSS, baggage detection and classification has a broad area of security applications. Some of them are, detecting carriage of illegal materials into baggage, detecting unclaimed baggage in public space that can be placed by terrorists for violence, detecting baggage in baggage restricted super shop etc. However, in this paper, a detection & classification framework of baggage is proposed using dynamic human body parameter with boosting strategy. Initially, background subtraction is performed instead of sliding window approach to speed up the system and HSI model is used to deal with uneven illumination condition. Then, to overcome the shadow effect a model is introduced. Extraction of rotational signal descriptor (RSD_HOG) from Region of Interest (ROI) added efficiency in HOG. Finally, dynamic approach in human body parameter setting enabled the system to detect & classify single or multiple carried baggages although some portions of human are absent. In baggage detection, boosting of similarity measure based cascade multilayer SVMs into HOG based SVM generated a strong classifier. This scheme has used to deal with various texture patterns of baggages. Experimental results discovered the system satisfactorily accurate and faster comparative to other alternatives.

Title: Video based pedestrian detection and tracking at night-time

Abstract: This paper is an approach for pedestrian detection and tracking with infrared imagery. The detection phase is performed by AdaBoost algorithm based on Haar-like features. AdaBoost classifier is trained with datasets generated from infrared images. The number of negative images used for training with AdaBoost algorithm is 3000. For positive training, 1000 samples are used After detecting the pedestrian with AdaBoost classifier, we proposed the Tracking-Learning-Detection (TLD) frameworks tracking strategies. TLD frameworks are preferred in this study because of its high accuracy rate and computation speed Tracking performance comparison is made between TLD and particle filtering. Results prove that TLD performs a higher tracking rate than particle filtering.

Title: Comparative study of modern convolutional neural networks for smoke detection on image data

Abstract: This work evaluates modern convolutional neural networks (CNN) for the task of smoke detection on image data. The networks that were tested are AlexNet, Inception-V3, Inception-V4, ResNet, VGG, and Xception. They all have shown high performance on huge ImageNet dataset, but the possibility of using such CNNs needed to be checked for a very specific task of smoke detection with a high diversity of possible scenarios and a small available dataset. Experimental results have shown that inception-based networks reach high performance when samples in the training dataset cover enough scenarios while accuracy dramatically drops when older networks are utilized.

Title: Interacting with a conversational agent system for educational purposes in online courses

Abstract: Since distance education creates new opportunities for learners, the enrollment in online courses has been sharply increasing in higher education. However, the higher attrition rate is one of the more significant concerns in this field. Educational researchers have found that meaningful interactions play a significant role in learner persistence in online courses. Still, it is challenging for an individual instructor to promote learners' positive interaction experiences. The expectation of improved learners' interaction with conversational agent systems has received attention in the distance education field. Few conversational agent systems have been developed for educational purposes, and few systems are used in real online learning settings. This study aims at designing and developing a conversational agent system to promote the learner's meaningful interaction in online courses, and also exploring the feasibility of human interaction with the conversational agent system, or chatbot, in online courses in higher education. The primary findings of this study show that instant, content-related, and quality interactions between the learner and the conversational agent system is applicable to graduate-level online courses. Implications and future research are discussed.

Title: Exploring effective learning resources affecting student behavior on distance education

Abstract: Learning Management System (LMS) is one of the online learning tool that used by one of private university in Indonesia. The private university began venturing into online learning, which more flexible for users, especially teachers and students. Online learning was implemented to build mutual knowledge, motivation, and communication for the sake of creating a collaborative and efficient learning environment and [1]-[6]. There were many perceptions about the form of effective online learning resources, which create an interesting teaching and learning process that engage and motivate students to learn. Currently, the most effective learning resources for students in online learning is still being debated. The contribution of this research was to discover the pattern of online learning users' behavior in Indonesia, especially students, find the most suitable and motivating learning resource for students, also improving the ease of learning material understanding. The research data was collected quantitatively using 730 students as a sample of the total 3870 students throughout the participants of online program, at one of a private university in Indonesia. Learning resources packaged in this among others: Lecture Note pdf-text, PowerPoints, Videos and Quizzes. In this paper, text-based has been found has a high role in motivating and facilitating for students to understand the material. The students believed both the learning resources have a relevance to the topics that covered in their courses, so that both learning resources become the main source of learning for students. Students regarded videos as additional resources, because it takes longer to understand the material in this type of sources.

Title: How active are K-12 students using Edmodo as online motivation, interaction and collaboration tools for learning process?

Abstract: Edmodo called as `Facebook for schools' [1] enable the academic social network site connecting students and teachers anywhere and anytime. It can be used to encourage students to complete activities assigned by teachers such as assignment and quiz posting, polls conducting, badges awarding, learning materials uploading, classroom discussions, grade tracking, and comments writing besides as personal digital library connected to Google drive, OneDrive, and much more. Accordingly, this paper provided a general overview of how students in class IX to XII of technology information and communication course fully participate in Edmodo. The main beneficial point of this research was the trend and analysis of K-12 students' participation at high school in Indonesia. Investigating the participation and factors underlying the students' patterns of behavior in Edmodo can provide guidelines for sustainable improvement of online learning management systems. The data analysis revealed that a high number of students join as members in Edmodo and only a few of them were not engaged due to limited access of internet. It was found that most of students in class XII-IPA were active in posting their assignments through Edmodo after school and that most dominant is class X. There were some discussions and sharing information between teacher-students and students-students related to the inside and outside classroom activities. The result also indicated that students in class XII were more active than those in class IX, X, and XI. Students of class XII are in the final year before joining universities. Thus, they were more serious about their study. Furthermore, the students found Edmodo as a communication tool and a user-friendly social learning platform enabling them to connect with classmates and teachers in online class. The results also inspired teachers to motivate and encourage the students' to do their best in the study and build a strong relationship inside and outside the class.

Title: The effect of lecturer leadership and organizational culture on the students' SPIRIT character building

Abstract: The long-term goal of this research is to accommodate the students' perceptions of the influence of the lecturer's leadership and the organizational culture to the students' SPIRIT character development. The method that be used in this research is by distributing questionnaires to the respondents and the data obtained were processed quantitatively with path analysis. The results showed that the leadership of the lecturer did not have significant influence, because it only accounted for 12.1%, while the effect of organizational culture on the students' SPIRIT character development is also not significant, which amounted to 6.4%. It can be concluded that the leadership and organizational culture have no significant effect on the students' SPIRIT character development. So, it is very necessary to develop leadership and organizational culture in order to give significant effect to the students' SPIRIT character building.

Title: Web and virtual reality as platforms to improve online education experiences

Abstract: Some universities and schools have offered virtual courses to their students as part of their official curriculum. Online learning is a coherent approach for contemporary education; however, some studies show it has some weaknesses that could be addressed to enhance its potential. In this paper, we argue how virtual reality improve online learning in some aspects, such as giving students the sense of presence in an immersive world, and bringing a new way to interact with colleagues and teachers when they are not in the same place. We also discuss the role of WebVR as an open platform to bring new possibilities to explore virtual reality worlds in education.

Title: Comparison of brain areas for executed and imagined movements after motor training: An fNIRS study

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate active brain regions for motor execution and motor imagination tasks after training with a rehabilitation robot. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is used to measure the hemodynamic responses in the motor cortices of five subjects. An assistive robot (IMT 2.0, connected to the right hand) is used during the training session to make the subject to reach a target point displayed on a computer screen. During the training, the subjects have to reach the target point in two directions (left and right) using right arm movement. Our intention is to investigate the differences between brain signals generated from left and right movements of the right hand. It was found that the same brain region was activated for both left- and right-directional motions. During the testing, we asked the subjects to imagine the executed movement. We found that although the imagined movement activity is weak but it appears in the same region as that of motor execution during the reach task. The results show that executed and imagined movements can be discriminated using fNIRS. However, for brain-computer interface it is difficult to generate two commands using only one arm movement signals.

Title: Gender differences in the use of SCREAM Rhetorical devices displayed on video presentations: (An analysis of undergraduate students' persuasive presentations)

Abstract: Delivering persuasive presentation is a challenging task for the university students. One of the difficult parts is grasping the attention of audiences during the critical situations, such as in the early morning or after the lunch break. At the situations, students are not paying more attention to any speeches or presentations occurred in the classroom because of some lapses of attention span such as poor listening, yawns, blurred visual images, and noisy situations. For that reasons, the study seeks to investigate the most preferred SCREAM Rhetorical devices used by male and female students when doing persuasive presentation and verify whether gender differences play a role in the way the male and female students exploited SCREAM Rhetorical devices to persuade the audiences. To explore the application of SCREAM Rhetorical devices, this study involved sixteen English Business Presentation students; eight males and eight females who were randomly selected to record the business presentation in video as multimedia learning device. Then, the presentations through the videos were analyzed using Windingland (2012) SCREAM taxonomy that comprises Rhetorical devices into six types: Simile, Contrast, Rhyme, Echo, Alliteration, and Metaphor. The significant findings proved that the presentations displayed on the videos showed that all respondents executed SCREAM Rhetorical devices. The gender differences influenced the SCREAM rhetorical devices used. Interestingly, of six devices, Echo is the most preferred device exploited in the students' persuasive presentation.

Title: Reduction of massive EEG datasets for epilepsy analysis using Artificial Neural Networks

Abstract: Epileptic seizure source identification involves neurologists combing through a substantial amount of data manually, which sometimes takes weeks per patient. This paper presents a methodology for minimizing the amount of data a neurologist has to analyze to identify the seizure focus. The method keeps the neurologist as the final decision maker and aids in the decision making process. It has to be noted that the primary focus of the work was not improving the accuracy of interictal spike detection but reduction of the volume of data. The presented methodology is based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and is implemented on EEG data collected on 5 patients using a dense array EEG reader. As a baseline, a simple template matching was implemented on the same dataset. Experimental results showed that the ANN based methodology was able to reduce the dataset by 98%, a significant improvement on the template matching method.

Title: E-learning design model integrated eel (Anguilla Sp.) in Indonesia based on Website

Abstract: Indonesia is an archipelago that is very spacious and contain many natural resources. Indonesian fish products mostly shipped to Japan, China, Korea, and several other countries in Asia and even to Americas. Fish production that become the subject of this study is the eel (Anguilla sp.). Japanese is the largest consumer of eel which consumes 55% of world production of eels. Eels farming has a great opportunity in Indonesia but eel resources has not been used optimally, because eel has not been known and most people in Indonesia are not accustomed to eating eel. Eels for export purposes are still many problems, it is need necessary strategic steps to allow Indonesia to export eels. It starts by identifying areas that have the potential eel resources ranging from seed to measure consumption and then try to improve the quality of export standards. Farmers should get knowledge on how to cultivate export-quality eel. This problem can be solved by utilizing Information and Communication Technology (ICT). Websites can be used as distance learning. This journal analyzes the needs of farmers, by designing an information system and technology.

Title: Dimensionality reduction of EEG signal using Fuzzy Discernibility Matrix

Abstract: High dimensionality of feature space is a problem in supervised machine learning. Redundant or superfluous features either slow down the training process or dilute the quality of classification. Many methods are available in literature for dimensionality reduction. Earlier studies explored a discernibility matrix (DM) based reduct calculation for dimensionality reduction. Discernibility matrix works only on discrete values. But most real-world datasets are continuous in nature. Use of traditional discernibility matrix approach inevitably incurs information loss due to discretization. In this paper, we propose a fuzzified adaptation of discernibility matrix with four variants of dissimilarity measure to deal with continuous data. The proposed algorithm has been applied on EEG dataset-III from BCI competition-II. The reduced dataset is then classified using Support Vector Machine (SVM). The performance of the proposed Fuzzy Discernibility Matrix (FDM) variants are compared with original discernibility matrix based method and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). In our empirical study, the proposed method outperforms the other two methods, thus suggesting that it is competitive with them.

Title: Design and development of low-cost assistive device for lower limb exoskeleton robot

Abstract: In this paper, we presented a low cost assistive device of an exoskeleton robot, to assist the lower limb muscle by following the gait pattern generation. The paper presents the technique how to duplicate the natural gait motion pattern based robotic platform from the neutral person motion as data pattern generation, to control the positioning of foot trajectory by following the data pattern generation which is performed by the embedded system. The distributed control is applied with four slave controllers and a master controller. Four slave controllers are performed to control the four dc motors for the joint revolute of hip and knee of both leg with the PID control technique of each joint. A master controller is to compute the data parameterized trajectories and the positioning of trajectory pattern. Our approach is successfully generated motion of the gait pattern and positioning control of the lower limp exoskeleton. The experimental results are demonstrated the gait pattern generation and robot locomotion.

Title: Presentation of contact information of industrial robot's end-effector using vibrotactile sensation

Abstract: Industrial robots are introduced in not only large enterprises but also small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Professional engineers are required when introducing and maintaining industrial robots. However, sometimes it is difficult for SMEs to do this by themselves because of economical limitations. Therefore, in many cases, they need to ask the outside for the support. To assist this situation, an aiding system for remote operation of industrial robots has been studied. This system provides information of the local site to an operator who is in the remote site using auditory and visual information. From this, the operator is able to perceive the working situation of the robot remotely. However, when several kinds of auditory information are presented at same time, recognition of the information becomes difficult. In addition, if too many kinds of visual information are presented, it is also difficult for the operator to pay attention appropriately. To solve the problem, we have proposed vibrotactile interfaces to assist information presentation for aiding remote operation of an industrial robot. In this paper, we attempt to present contact information using a vibrotactile glove when contact between an end-effector of a robot and an object occurs. We proposed two types of vibration stimuli to present the contact information. We investigate how human subjects correctly perceive the contact information through the vibration-based presentations compared with a visual based presentation. Subjects? performance of the contact information perception is evaluated based on perceived time, cognitive time and correct answer rate of the contact information.

Title: Text-to-speech of a talking robot for interactive speech training of hearing impaired

Abstract: The authors are developing a talking robot which is a mechanical vocalization system modeling the human articulatory system. The talking robot is constructed with mechanical parts that are made by referring to human vocal organs biologically and functionally. In this study, a newly redesign artificial vocal cord is developed for the purpose of extending the speaking capability of the talking robot. The artificial vocal cord is developed using functional approach. A thin layer of rubber band with a width of 7mm is attached on a plastic body in a sealed chamber creates an artificial sound source. The fundamental frequency of the sound source vary from 80Hz to 280 Hz depending on the pressure to the rubber band and the curving shape of the rubber band. The curving shape of the rubber band is adjustable by an innovative design mechanism driven by a servo motor. The amount of air pressure applied to the rubber band is controlled by another servo motor which is referred as volume motor in this study. The experiment to verify the speak capability of the talking robot with this newly redesigned vocal cord is conducted by letting the robot generating five vowel sounds with difference combination of 20 levels of rubber band shape and 10 levels of air pressure input. The pitch and volume of each sound is extracted to determine the effect of the rubber band shape and the pressure input on the output sound. The result shows that this newly redesigned vocal cord greatly increase the speaking capability of the talking robot, especially its singing performance.

Title: Classification of human fall in top Viewed kinect depth images using binary support vector machine

Abstract: Vision based human fall action classification from non fall has been given significant importance over the past decade since the rise of falling events related to elderly people living alone has increased. This paper proposes a method to classify falls from non fall action in top Viewed kinect camera depth images. The usage of depth camera images provides an effective solution regarding privacy concerns and the top Viewed camera output has an added advantage of reducing occlusion effect in the cluttered home environment. Our method considers a fixed background setting overall the experiments and foreground is obtained by frame differencing. Then the human silhouette is extracted by largest connected component selection. Ellipse Fit over the human silhouette is used to obtain feature vectors. A binary support vector machine(SVM)classifier is used to distinguish fall from non falling frames. The proposed method is tested over[6] UR fall detection dataset providing a platform for comparison to other researchers.

Title: Reaction force estimation and bilateral control of master slave manipulation using a robust controller

Abstract: In this paper, proposed a reaction force estimation and bilateral control of master slave manipulation in hydraulic servo system based on Sliding mode control with sliding perturbation observer (SMCSPO). The reaction force is estimated by sliding perturbation observer (SPO) without using any force sensor. The estimated reaction force without force sensor is transmitted to the master device using the impedance model controller. Sliding mode control (SMC) is used to a bilateral controller for the position and force tracking control of a slave. This study proves in experiment that the slaver of a hydraulic servo system can follow the trajectory of the master device (Human Command) using the bilateral control scheme.

Title: An output feedback tracking control based on neural sliding mode and high order sliding mode observer

Abstract: In this paper, a novel output feedback tracking control scheme based on neural sliding mode without joint velocity measurement and the high order sliding mode observer for the uncertainty of robot manipulators are presented. Two second-order sliding mode observers are designed to estimate joint velocities and dynamic uncertainties of the robot manipulator, respectively. The first-second order sliding mode observer is used to estimate the state vector in a finite time without filtration. To estimate the uncertainties without filtration, the second second-order sliding mode nonlinear observer is designed. By integrating two observers, the resulting observer can theoretically obtain exact estimations of both joint velocities and dynamic uncertainties. They are used to design an output feedback tracking control scheme based on neural sliding mode controller. This proposed control scheme can reduce chattering and improves tracking performances. Finally, the simulation for a 2-DOF robot manipulator is given to show the effectiveness of this control strategy.

Title: Fruitylicious: Mobile application for fruit ripeness determination based on fruit image

Abstract: Development of local fruit industry in Indonesia is very high, but less competitive than imported fruits. Produced fruit kinds in this country is very diverse, but the use of technology to support the production and distribution is still not widely applied. This makes the local fruit market less competitive than imported fruits that has largely been applying technology production support. In this research, we analyse the relationship between fruit digital image and sweetness level of it. Image processing method carried out to prepare a digital image that is ready to be processed in the matching stage. K-Nearest Neighbor method is used to match fruit digital image with its sweetness levels. Sweetness levels were measured using Brix degrees' units. Matching results would be useful to predict fruit ripeness based on digital image, so that the conventional measurement methods that should spoil the fruit can be handled. Experiments were performed in several types of fruits include: bananas, apples and melons. Each of these fruit image is recorded from several difference angles. We also measured levels of sweetness using a sweetness measuring instrument, called refractometer. Both of these will become the training materials for classification system and then performed using kNN. The resulting method of this research is implemented in the application, named Fruitylicious.

Title: Predicting students performance in final examination using linear regression and multilayer perceptron

Abstract: Currently, many educational institutions are highly oriented to improve the quality of education and students? learning achievement-examination result. To fulfil such intention, predicting students? performance by analyzing their learning behavior is one of the best way can be taken into account. Once the performance was predicted, it will be easy for teachers, school authority or other related parties to determine the appropriate policies on the issue. Relatedly, this paper aimed to provide the prediction of students? performance in final examination by applying linear regression and multilayer perceptron in WEKA- in terms of accuracy, performance and error rate- to compare their feasibility. The basis of data was derived from extraction and analysis of e-learning logged-post in discussion forum and attendance. Based on the result, it has been concluded that multilayer perceptron provides better prediction results of final examination than linear regression.

Title: A synthesized method of result merging in meta-search engine

Abstract: Meta-search engine is a comprehensive search tool, which is build base on those member search engines. All result entities reported by member search engines are merged into one ranked list according to their quality. It is well knowing that the core problem in meta-search engine is how to merge the results and provide user with a more effective rank list. This paper dealt with a synthesized merging algorithm by utilizing five features to estimate the quality of each result entity. For a returned result entity, we first record its' position of the original result list. Secondly, count the number of duplications. Thirdly, calculate the similarity between query terms and result content. Fourthly, get the capacity of the search members which will be called later. Fifth, analyze whether the current entity is in line with user's interests. Wherein users' interests are obtained both according to users' browsing history and feedback. Finally, we use the linear fusion model to merge the results set and re-ranking the results list. Experimental results shown that the merging method we proposed in this paper improved the accuracy and satisfaction degree in some cases compared with member search engines and several current meta-search engines.

Title: Improving sentiment classification through distinct word selection

Abstract: While the performance of sentiment classification has steadily risen through the introduction of various feature-based methods and distributed representation-based approaches, less attention was given to the qualitative aspect of classification, for instance, the identification of useful words in individual opinion texts. We present an approach using set operations for identifying useful words for sentiment classification, and employ truncated singular value decomposition (SVD), a classic low-rank matrix decomposition technique for document retrieval, in order to tackle the issue of both synonymy and noise removal. The sentiment classification performance of our approach, which concatenates three kinds of features, outperforms the existing word-based and distributed word representation-based methods and is comparable to the existing state of the art distributed document representation-based approaches.

Title: To classify two-dimensional motion state of step length and walking speed by applying cerebral hemoglobin information

Abstract: This paper presents a research on classifying walking speed and step length simultaneously by using cerebral hemoglobin information. Nine healthy subjects performed walking task spontaneously in three levels of speed and three levels of step length. Brain information of the subjects was measured by using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) technology. The differences between the oxygenated hemoglobin (oxyHb) and deoxygenated hemoglobin (deoxyHb) were decomposed by wavelet packet. Feature vectors were extracted in both the time domain and frequency domain. Walking speed and step length was identified by applying support vector machine (SVM) method. The preliminary identification accuracy was 62.97%. This finding puts forward a new method for identifying two-dimensional state of lower limbs in level walking. And it lays a foundation for realizing autonomous control of walking-assistive equipment.

Title: Evaluation of feature based image stitching algorithm using OpenCV

Abstract: Image stitching is an attractive method to merging multiple images. It can produce a wide-angle panoramic photograph while maintaining the quality of the source images. The process is simply performed by overlapping part of the images which contain common scene. Today, panoramic image stitching is widely used in applications such as 360-degree cameras and virtual reality photography. If the stitching technology ensure fast processing speed and accurate performance, it is expected to produce diverse image contents in real time. Moreover, the panoramic images can be mapped to various projective layouts, e.g. spherical and stereographic projection. The mapping of the panoramic image along the suitable projective layout makes it possible to express more stereoscopic space, that is, the space in the photo can give the impression that it looks as if it is in front. It can be utilized when creating 3D reconstruction space with high-resolution panoramic images. This paper describes the concept of feature based image stitching and presents the implementation results. It also provides the results of stitching with more than 10 images and suggests the time-efficient way for stitching multiple images. The time-efficient stitching method can be applied to various applications so that panoramic images can be easily accessed in everyday life.

Title: An improved method for 3D shape estimation using active shape model

Abstract: This paper tackles the problem of reconstructing 3D human poses from 2D landmarks, which is still an ill-posed problem. A widely-used approach is active shape model (ASM) which considers an unknown 3D shape as a linear combination of predefined basis shapes. The existing methods often resolve an optimization problem to reckon the weights and viewpoints of basis shapes, but they could fall into a locally-optimal and/or not use in the real-time system. In this paper, we propose an improved method by doing categorize database into subspaces to reduce execution time and make reconstruction accuracy better in four steps: (i) Separating 3D shapes in training database into subspaces based on their features. (ii) Learning predefined basis shapes of each subspace. (iii) Reconstructing 3D human poses from basis shapes of all subspaces. (iv) Picking out the best shape among them as the final result.

Title: Lane marking detection using image features and line fitting model

Abstract: The lane marking detection task is an essential process in the field of semi-autonomous and autonomous navigation. This paper proposes a method that combines the color and edge information to robustly detect the lane marking within the image either located far on near to the vehicle. Firstly, the region of interest is extracted from the image. Secondly, the set of lane marking features are extracted. To do that, the change in color between road and marking surface is used along a probability density function to extract the set of candidates. Finally, a clustering method along a line fitting model is implemented. Preliminary results were performed and tested on a group of consecutive frames to prove the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Title: Multi-layer superpixel-based MeshStereo for accurate stereo matching

Abstract: This paper describes an approach to generate a dense disparity map between the stereo pairs using the multilayer superpixel with the different size. We assume the pixels within superpixel belong to the same 3D surface. The pixel-wise matching costs are computed with census and gradient features. Then, the input stereo images are segmented into M layers superpixel. SLIC algorithm is used to obtain superpixel. The disparity map for each superpixel image is generated by optimizing a superpixel grid MRF. There are the overlapping regions regardless of the size of the superpixel. The multiple disparity maps are merged by using the median filter.

Title: Driver drowsiness monitoring by learning vehicle telemetry data

Abstract: For a safety critical task like driving, it is very important for the driver to be vigilant at all times. In this study, we explore a driver drowsiness monitoring and early warning system, which uses machine learning techniques based on vehicle telemetry data. The proposed system can ensure safe driving by real time monitoring of driving pattern. This proves to be a very cost effective technique over biometric and camera based techniques since it doesn't involve expensive sensors. The detection of drowsy state of a driver is modeled as a binary classification issue. We outline the design methodology followed and challenges faced in developing a machine learning based classification scheme on vehicle telemetry data, which is essentially a time-series data. Even though our study is focused on an exemplary application like driver attention monitoring, the results can be equally applied for vehicle prognostics, driving style analytics and various other telematics applications in automotive industry. We have done our entire development and validation on a driver-in-loop simulation platform.

Title: Dynamic user interfaces for control systems

Abstract: Control systems monitor and command other devices, systems, and software within an infrastructure. Typically, control systems employ human-in-the-loop control for critical decision making and response. These end-users require easy access to accurate, actionable and relevant data to ensure quick and effective decision making. This work presents a framework for creating dynamic visual interfaces for improved situational awareness. The proposed framework determines the relevance of available information pieces and then applies the derived relevance scores to a visualization so that the most relevant and important information are emphasized to the end-users. In the presented work, a priori expert knowledge is encoded in the system through the use of Fuzzy Logic (FL) and the resulting FL inference system assigns scores to information pieces based on system state information and user defined relevance. These scores can then be used to organize and display the relevant data given the current situation and end-user roles. The proposed FL based scoring system was implemented on a real world control system dataset and we demonstrate how the information visualization is dynamically adapted to improve situational awareness. Further, we discuss potential methods the relevance scores can be incorporated into real world visualizations to increase the situational awareness in control systems.

Title: A low-cost implementation of an eye tracking system for driver's gaze analysis

Abstract: We present an eye tracking system developed to study the driver's gaze behavior while driving a car. Two main challenges distinguish this project from similar works with analogous purposes: (1) the use of a cheap portable remote eye tracker, normally employed for indoor applications in controlled light conditions; and (2) the use of an ordinary webcam to shoot the road in front of the car. The purpose is to generate a video where the driver's fixations are graphically and dynamically superimposed on the road shot by webcam (taking into account the different viewpoints of driver and camera). The carried-out experiments confirmed that the implemented system, while perfectible, fulfills the requirements initially set.

Title: Enhanced concert experience using multimodal feedback from live performers

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to enhance the interaction between the performer and the audience in live idol performances. We propose a system for converting the movements of individual members of an idol group into vibrations and their voices into light on handheld devices for the audience. Specifically, for each performer, the system acquires data on movement and voice magnitudes via an acceleration sensor attached to the right wrist and microphone. The obtained data is then converted into motor vibrations and lights from an LED. The receiving devices for the audience members come in the form of a pen light or doll. A prototype system was made to collect acceleration data and voice magnitude data measurements for our experiments with an idol group in Japan to verify whether the performer's movements and singing voice could be correctly measured during real live performance conditions. We developed a program to present the strength of the movements and singing voice corresponding to one of the members as vibrations and lights based on the information of the recorded data. Then, an experiment was conducted for eight subjects that observed the performance. We found that seven out of eight subjects could identify the idol performer with corresponding vibrations and lighting from the device.

Title: Probabilistic adjustment of dwell time for eye typing

Abstract: Requiring a dwell time before selection is a common way to solve “Midas-touch problem” in gaze-based interaction. Choosing the dwell time involves a tradeoff between unintentional selection for short dwell times and slow text entry for long dwell times. We propose a probabilistic model for gaze based selection, which adjusts the dwell time based on the probability of each letter based on the past letters selected. By reformulating the entire problem of gaze-based selection probabilistically, we can naturally integrate the probability of each character naturally and with very few prior assumptions and very few free parameters. It automatically assigns shorter dwell times to more likely characters and longer dwell times to less likely characters. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed technique speeds up typing without loss in accuracy. The concept of this can be generalized to other dwell-based applications, leading to more efficient gaze system interaction.

Title: Study on play specific to the saddle type interface for personal mobility

Abstract: The saddle type human body movement interface uses not only translational movements but also a twisting movement for controlling a personal mobility. The saddle is mounted on a personal mobility through a universal joint having 3 axes, and follows human body movement. One axis following the body movement on forward/backward is used for making the control input (velocity) of a personal mobility. And two axes on translational right/left and twisting right/left are used for making the control input of angular velocity. For making these control inputs, appropriate plays on each axis should be considered, because play of an interface absorbs low precise and small human movement in order not to reflect these movement to a machine's movement for providing high usability. This paper, therefore, experimentally investigates typical ranges of play (software backlash) on the saddle type interface, and implements them into the control scheme for the personal mobility, and evaluate it.

Title: The acceptance of social network: The role of status seeking on TAM

Abstract: Online social networks are progressively being adopted among young people in developing countries. The public is questioning why so many people adopt this technology in many aspects of their lives? The purpose of this study is to understand the acceptance of social networks by Thai students. We used traditional TAM's behavioral constructs: subjective norms (SN), perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use (PEOU), and behavioral intention (BI) together with status seeking (SS) to answer the question. We surveyed 350 Thai university students and use structural equation modelling (SEM) for the analysis. The findings depict a significant theoretical model and suggest the future research.

Abstract: Mass Media have been acknowledged as a mean to shape the way people view the world. It indeed constructs the individual and social world. The evolution of human thinking is always changing as the development of media technology. Human creates communication technology as a tool to overcome the obstacles in communication. However, these tools are eventually shape human perspective to view the world. One of the content that people can see in mass media is culture. It spread massively through various mass media as a product and content. Through the mass media people can see other culture. From the culture they have seen in mass media, they eventually construct their own culture. One of the culture they have formed is cosplay. Therefore, this research is questioning about to what extent the mass media role had construct the reality of self-identity and social world of cosplayer. Secondly, how mass media had developed the hyper reality of cosplayer which it's reflected in cosplayer behavior. This paper had done with qualitative analysis. It means that the analysis did from the beginning until the end of the research. The result of this research shows that mass media, especially of video game and film have significant role to develop the cosplayer hyper-reality and identity. Those bring the cosplayer choose the character that represents their self-identity to play. Through this new identity, cosplayer forms the community to share their experience.

Title: Powerfully tecnologized, powerlessly connected: The psychosemiotics of nomophobia

Abstract: This article studies nomophobia as a modern psychological attachment to smartphone as studied through Mophie advertisement “All Powerless”. Studies have shown that most youngsters suffer nomophobia to a certain degree ranging from mild to severe. In Indonesia, all studied participants are nomophobic with 71.42% suffer moderate nomophobia, 19.04% severe and 9.52% mild. Through the psychosemiotic study of nomophobia in the ad, it is concluded that beyond the surface denotative meaning that the ad is designed to simultaneously invite consumers to buy it and legitimize the disappearance of nomophobia, the deeper ideological meaning has surfaced: people have been psychologically attached too much to the very technology than to other human beings and God, signifying all are powerless in the face of technology.

Title: Toward Explainable Deep Neural Network Based Anomaly Detection

Abstract: Anomaly detection in industrial processes is crucial for general process monitoring and process health assessment. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) based anomaly detection has received increased attention in recent work. Albeit their high accuracy, the black-box nature of DNNs is a drawback in practical deployment. Especially in industrial anomaly detection systems, explanations of DNN detected anomalies are crucial. This paper presents a framework for DNN based anomaly detection which provides explanations of detected anomalies. The framework answers the following questions during online processing: 1) “why is it an anomaly?” and 2) “what is the confidence?” Further, the framework can be used offline to evaluate the “knowledge” of the trained DNN. The framework reduces the opaqueness of the DNN based anomaly detector and thus improves human operators' trust in the algorithm. This paper implements the first steps of the presented framework on the benchmark KDD-NSL dataset for Denial of Service (DoS) attack detection. Offline DNN explanations showed that the DNN was detecting DoS attacks based on features indicating destination of connection, frequency and amount of data transferred while showing an accuracy around 97%.

Title: NIRS-SPM Analysis of Body Schema Modification and Performance of Body Motion

Abstract: On manipulation of objects for a person, body schema modification plays an important role to grasp the spatial relation between he/she and the object. In order to investigate the relation between body schema modification and performance of the spatial manipulation in this study, participants performed a task of tracing Japanese characters using sticks having different lengths, and their cerebral blood flow were measured during the task. Since body schema is a higher-order function of the brain, statistical parametric mapping (SPM) was used to elucidate the function. More over an improvement of the task performance by interference to the body schema by applying transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) with different intensities was tried, where the task performance means accuracy of the manipulation of object. Applying SPM analysis, a significant difference at Brodmann area 7 (BA7) and BA40 was confirmed when length of stick was the longest, which induced strongest body schema modification in our experimental condition. There was a significant difference in BA21 and BA39 when accuracy of the manipulation of object was different according to the length of the stick. Applying TENS to enhance the body schema modification, a significant different activation in BA19 and BA37 was confirmed. In conclusion, the brain part which related to accuracy of the hand manipulation were clarified. Moreover, we suggested TENS enable to change accuracy of the hand manipulation.

Title: Optical Sensor Based Gestures Inference Using Recurrent Neural Network in Mobile Conditions

Abstract: In this paper the implementation of recurrent neural network models for hand gesture recognition on edge devices was performed. The models were trained with 27 hand gestures recorded with the use of a linear optical sensor consisting of 8 photodiodes and 4 LEDs. Different models, trained off-line, were tested in terms of inference time on several mobile devices. The impact of different network topologies (different number of neurons and layers) and different effective sampling frequency of a recorded gesture on the inference time were evaluated. Inference time tests performed on the most effective of available platforms, Samsung Galaxy S8 smartphone, present that recurrent neural networks trained on unprocessed (raw) data from the gesture sensor (1-layer model) execute faster than models trained on differently processed features (2 and 3-layer models): 374ms vs 765ms and 1048ms for data recorded with 100Hz. Also, the reduction of effective sampling frequency allows to shorten the inference time, e.g., for raw data from 374ms at 100Hz to 115ms at 25Hz. Presented results confirm the usability of low complexity interfaces like linear gesture sensor in mobile devices with limited computational capabilities, which allows to consider such sensors in wearable electronic devices e.g. smart glasses.

Title: Convolutional Neural Network Based Femur Stabilization for X-Ray Image Sequences

Abstract: Sequence stabilization of medical images is an important aspect of diagnosis, therapy, joint movement kinematic analysis, and cancer detection. Typically, when image frames are recorded, the body is not rigidly fixed as a result of e.g. respiration, thus the position of its segments may vary. Simple image analysis methods (e.g. gradient based, scale-space based) tend to have problems with discerning the key-points in this specific task, due to large diversity of bone structure and highly visible soft tissue. In this paper, we propose a specialized algorithm for stabilization of femur in a sequence of single plane fluoroscopic images. The method estimates the positions of several easily-detectable femur key-points using gradient-based image analysis methods. For other key-points, which are located in the regions of bone with saliency prohibiting effective detection, we use feedforward Convolutional Neural Network as a position estimator. All the key-point positions are used in a stabilization process performed with the ICP (Iterative Closest Point) algorithm. The overall stabilization accuracy is evaluated for two uncorrelated X-ray image sequences, where manual stabilization (i.e., the results for image alignment performed by a human operator without access to key-points) constitutes the ground truth.

Title: Deep Self-Organizing Maps for Visual Data Mining

Abstract: Visual data mining facilitates the involvement of domain experts in the data mining processes. The effectiveness of visual data mining is especially dominant when paired with unsupervised methods due to the abundance of unlabeled data. Deep Self-Organizing Maps (DSOMs) are unsupervised learning architectures capable of high level feature abstraction. In this paper, we analyze the effectiveness of using DSOMs for visual data mining. DSOM's visual data mining capability was evaluated using the following visual data explorations methodologies: 1) U-Matrix, 2) hit maps and 3) data histograms. In comparison with traditional single layered SOM architectures, experimental results showed that DSOMs produced more accurate visual representations of the underlying data distributions. Therefore, DSOM is a viable method for generating easily understandable visual representations of high-dimensional complex datasets. These visual representations can be powerful tools in the real world, leading to better understanding of systems and thus enabling the design of better algorithms for control and monitoring.

Title: Recognition of Continuous Sign Language Alphabet Using Leap Motion Controller

Abstract: This paper describes the development of an SLR system for Israeli Sign Language designed to enable people with hearing impairments to communicate easily and independently using sign language. The research focuses on fingerspelling and the problem of acquiring and extracting data from signers and translating it into written form. SLR entails two main challenges. The first involves acquiring isolated instances of letters and translating each letter individually. This was accomplished by training the Support Vector Machines classifiers using vectors consisting of the Euclidean distances between the fingertips and the center of the palm. The second and more complex challenge involves translating a signed word and converting it into a stream of letters. This was solved in two sub-stages: extracting a single frame from the Leap controller and identifying the sign formed in that frame; and analyzing a continuous stream of frames and determining when the signs for a letter are formed. The recognition process in the system developed, eventually combined the letters to form words, moreover, provides a low-cost solution and is, therefore, suitable for everyone.

Title: The Interaction Design and its Evaluation of a Business-to-Business Website via Kansei Engineering

Abstract: User-centered philosophy is the trend of modern website design and its construction nowadays. In this paper, the methods of Kansei Engineering are imported to help improving the interact efficiency of an online Business-to-Business commercial website. First we collect the statistics result of up to 80 samples of user investigation, then the way of semantic differential has been used to reduce data dimension. The obtained representatively numerical knowledge makes it more effective for designer to carry interaction design in the prophase process. The website is redesigned accordingly. In later period, the skill of Kansei Engineering is still used to evaluate the effects of former design, new design and two competitors' website design. Experimental results show that the new design surpasses than others. And our proposed method could get more objective and more accurately of interaction than traditional experience-based design.

Title: A Method for the Design of Lean Human-Robot Interaction

Abstract: The high system flexibility necessary for the full automation of complex and unstructured tasks leads to increased complexity, thus higher costs. On the other hand, the effectiveness and performance of such systems decrease, explaining the unfulfilled potential of robotics in sectors such as intralogistics, where the benefits of a robotic solution rarely justify its costs. Taking the distance from the false idea that a task should be either fully automated, or fully manual, this paper presents a method for design of a lean human-robot interaction (HRI) with the objective of the “right level of automation”, where functions are divided among human and automated agents, so that the overall process gains in performances and/or costs. The proposed Quality Interaction Function Deployment method, thanks to its quantitative approach, serves three main purposes: (1) the design of a desired HRI that does not yet exist (development from scratch), (2) the re-engineering of an existing HRI and (3) the documentation of the whole design or re-engineering process. The 10 progressive steps of the method are presented and discussed with reference to their graphical tool: the House of Quality Interaction.

Title: Vocalic Segments Classification Assisted by Mouth Motion Capture

Abstract: Visual features convey important information for automatic speech recognition (ASR), especially in noisy environment. The purpose of this study is to evaluate to what extent visual data (i.e. lip reading) can enhance recognition accuracy in the multi-modal approach. For that purpose motion capture markers were placed on speakers' faces to obtain lips tracking data during speaking. Different parameterizations strategies were tested and the accuracy of phonemes recognition in different experiments was analyzed.

Title: Blood Pressure Estimation Based on Blood Flow, ECG and Respiratory Signals Using Recurrent Neural Networks

Abstract: The estimation of systolic and diastolic blood pressure using artificial neural network is considered in the paper. The blood pressure values are estimated using pulse arrival time, and additionally RR intervals of ECG signal together with respiration signal. A single layer recurrent neural network with hyperbolic tangent activation function was used. The average blood pressure estimation error for the data obtained from 21 subjects from MIMIC database was equal to 2.490 mmHg with standard deviation equal to 1.063 mmHg for systolic blood pressure, and was equal to 1.330 mmHg with standard deviation equal to 0.627 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure using vanilla recurrent neural networks. Similar results were obtained for long short term memory cells. The simulation shows that taking into account pulse arrival time together with RR intervals and respiration signal gave better results than pulse arrival time alone.

Title: Generating Musical Expression of MIDI Music with LSTM Neural Network

Abstract: Musicians aim to express emotions through musical performances. Technically, musical expression is mainly created by variances in tempo and dynamics. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the possibility of generating dynamics and expressive tempo for plain (inexpressive) MIDI files by means of a long short-term memory (LSTM) artificial neural network. Two neural network models (for dynamics and tempo separately) were built with the use of Keras deep learning library and trained on a dataset consisting of Chopin's mazurkas. The trained models are capable of generating expressive performance of inexpressive mazurka represented in MIDI format. The generated performances are evaluated by comparing the resulting dynamics and tempo graphs to human performances and by a survey testing the ease of differentiation between human and generated performance. The conclusion of the research is that expression generated with LSTM network can be very similar to human expression and convincing for listeners.

Title: Associative Graph Data Structures with an Efficient Access via AVB+trees

Abstract: This paper introduces a new efficient associative graph data structure with efficient access to all stored data inspired by biological neural networks and associative brain-like approaches. It also introduces new self-balancing, self-organizing, and self-sorting AVB+trees which not only store data but it also allows for replacing many search operations with this structure. This structure aggregates representations of all duplicated of values and objects. It also allows for faster computation of many useful functions as medians, average, minima, maxima, neighbor values in the defined order etc. It always stores all data in order for all attributes simultaneously. Automatic aggregations of duplicates allow it for access to all stored data in less than logarithmic time. These associative structures can also be successfully used as a kind of artificial neural network for classification, clustering, various inferences, estimation of similarities, differences, or correlations of the stored objects.

Title: Improved Situational Awareness in ROS Using Panospheric Vision and Virtual Reality

Abstract: One of the main difficulties in teleoperated systems is providing an operator with sufficient Situational Awareness (SA). This paper introduces three open-source packages that improve the operator's SA using the Robot Operating System (ROS). The first package-rviz_textured_sphere-allows rendering panospheric camera outputs as spherical images in the ROS visualization software RViz. A system where the visualization of this spherical data using an open-source virtual reality (OSVR) headset in the ROS framework is achieved with the second package: rviz_plugin_osvr. Finally, the third package-pointcloud_painter-projects spherical data onto a 3D depth cloud scan of the scene generated from a rotating lidar. This package outputs a XYZRGB pointcloud that can be visualized either in RViz or using the virtual reality headset. Together, these technologies address the wider issue of limited SA in robotics and represent a substantial advancement in the environment visualization capabilities available to open-source robotics developers.

Title: Emerged Theoretical Constructs to Rethink HCI Design

Abstract: Despite incompatible theoretical perspectives on emotion in psychology, researchers in HCI continue to identify frustration as a basic negative ae ctive reaction or enotion, a single predictor of goal satisfaction and a persistent problem with use of technology. Applying the Grounded Theory approach, we argue that the reported causes of frustration were not necessarily resulting in frustrating experiences, making frustration an unreliable predictor and at best a small part of a bigger problem: an individual negative experience, which we argue is a better predictor. The Grounded Theory approach allowed us to better generalize newly emerged concepts and categories, connecting them causally, consequentially or conditionally to human use of technology. This paved the way to find a knowledge gap in HCI theory, treating basic psychological needs from an eudaimonic perspective, and which could be addressed by developing potentially universally applicable new design principles. The emerged concepts include: a) the human-complex system interaction construct; b) the distinction of reactive and proactive design approaches; c) the perspective of designing for human well-being; and d) four distinct phases of disrupted interaction. In addition, we propose specific steps for the evaluation of HCI design to help minimize negative user experience.

Title: The Study of Driver's Brain Activity and Behavior Using fNIRS During Actual Car Driving

Abstract: In this study, based on the measurement of brain activity and the change of accelerator and brake stroke, we tried to grasp the interaction between the driver's reaction and the driver's following behavior at the time when driver watched Variable Message Sign on actual car driving. Specifically, using fNIRS, we analyzed same driver's brain activity and driving behavior during actual car driving, and then we evaluated the interaction of both items. As a result, we confirmed that parietal association cortex and prefrontal area activated in the case of driving with recognition and judgment for the information which a driver collected from the environment during driving. Then it was suggested that it was needed to expand parietal association cortex in order to measure the brain activity. Furthermore, it was suggested that both on and off accelerator stroke were connected with the activity of prefrontal area. As a result, it was suggested that it was valid to confirm the driver's reaction at every steps, such as “recognition”, “judgment”, “behavior”, by means of being approached from a neuroscience.

Title: A Sensory Substitution Device Inspired by the Human Visual System

Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to introduce and initially evaluate an experimental sensory substitution device (SSD), which converts color to audible sound. Our system, called Colorophone provides continuous information about the color, light intensity and distance. The color sonification method is inspired by the human visual system. While designing sonification method we took into consideration mismatch in sensory bandwidth, possible sensory overload, nature of sensory spatiotemporal continuity and cross-modal correspondences between colors and sounds. We conducted a preliminary experimental evaluation of the color and object recognition abilities as well as orientation ability. We show that blindfolded participants can easily acquire the color information coded in the auditory stimuli generated by the Colorophone system after a short learning session. Our preliminary experiments indicate that sonified color information helps in object identification and enhances orientation ability. The Colorophone proved to be an easy to understand and intuitive visual-to-auditory coding system, which shows promising results in future visual rehabilitation of the blind.

Title: New Automatic Algorithms for Computing Characteristics of Three Dimensional Pelvic and Lower Limb Motions in Race Walking

Abstract: Optical motion systems are precise and thus they may be applied in analysis of athletes' performance. It is particularly important in the analysis of motion in walker sports where pelvic rotation translates into movement speed. The aim of this paper is to present and test algorithms that can be used in analysis of the workload on the pelvic hyperextension at the knee, and the resulting movement speed during race walking. The test data were obtained by organizing a motion capture session whose participant was a woman professional race walker and a member of the National Senior Team. The algorithms presented compute parameters that strictly characterize race walking. They include: race walking speed, pelvic rotation angles and knee deflection angles. The test recordings were made using a Vicon motion capture system. The frame rate was set to 100 frames per second. The session was conducted in a shaded room so that no additional reflections appeared. The equipment was supplied with Vicon's Nexus 2.0 software, which was used for system calibration, data recording and data processing. The participant was measured for the purpose of creating and scaling a new subject, which was in turn required for computing the motion parameters. The results include computed pelvis rotation, knee flexion angles, walking speed as well as execution times of the proposed algorithms. Execution times are very short. The longest execution time of 0.15 seconds was recorded for a C3D file consisting of 192 frames and containing a recording of race-walking on the distance of 5.3 meters.

Title: Classifying Cognitive Workload Based on Brain Waves Signal in the Arithmetic Tasks' Study

Abstract: Cognitive workload is a quantitative usage measure of the limited amount of working memory. Its measuring is of great importance for understanding human mental effort processing, evaluating information systems or supporting diagnosis and treatment of patients. The paper presents the results of cognitive workload classification of electroencephalographic (EEG) data. The performed study covered arithmetic tasks realised in several intervals with the increasing difficulty level. Brain waves data in the form of EEG signal were gathered and processed in the form of frequency spectra. The paper discusses the process of features selection performed with several methods including ranking methods (K-Fisher), Feature Selection By Eigenvector Centrality (ECFS) and Mitinffs mutual information-based approach. What is more, the paper presents results of participant cognitive workload classification based on such methods as Support Vector Machines (SVM), boosted trees and k-nearest neighbours (KNN) algorithm. The paper discusses the efficiency of features selection methods and accuracy of applied classification methods.

Title: ANFIS Post-Processing for Real Time Gait Detection and Classification

Abstract: Gait detection and distinction from other movement patterns like descending the stairs is a crucial task for an exoskeleton supporting user movement. Active or quasi-passive exoskeletons should enhance wearer's limbs only in a manner of not interfering with natural gait patterns. Common solutions for this problem are numerous gait detection algorithms that among other sensors use force sensing resistors. In this paper, we propose using an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) classifier that can be trained on a stationary computer and only evaluated in a real time microprocessor control system. What is more, we propose altering the ANFIS outcome with five post-processing algorithms. Each network and algorithm combination is evaluated, results are compared and the best combined classifier is chosen.

Title: Interpretable Data-Driven Modeling in Biomass Preprocessing

Abstract: Data-driven models provide a powerful and flexible modeling framework for decision making and controls in industry. However, extracting knowledge from these models requires development of easily interpretable visualizations. In this paper, we present a data-driven methodology for modeling and visualization of relative equipment workload in a biomass feedstock preprocessing plant. The methodology is designed to serve in two main fronts: (1) knowledge discovery and data-mining from instrumentation data, (2) improving situational awareness during monitoring and control of the plant. We used Gaussian Processes to create a model of the expected current overload rate of for each of the electric motors involved in the plant. The expected number of overloads on each equipment was used to quantify and visualize the relative workload of the different components of the system. The visualization is presented in the form of an intuitive directed graph, whose properties (node size, position, colors) are driven by overload rates estimations.

Title: Analysis of the Accuracy of Pulse Estimation Using Smart Watches

Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to perform an analysis of the accuracy of the pulse estimation by comparing readings from a smartwatch with readings from medical devices. The study required writing applications that allow continuous pulse measurement. As a result, two applications were created for the smartwatch. The first one is dedicated to Android Wear devices, while the other one is compatible with Tizen watches. The next step was to create another application using a phone with a camera and a flashlight. The current heart rate value could be obtained by putting a finger to the lens of the camera and its flashlight, followed by a suitable pulse calculation algorithm. At the end of the experiment, a short and non-obligatory form for the gender, age and cardiovascular diseases of the person could be filled and the results are recorded in the database in a way that they could be compared with the measurements from watches. After collecting the intended amount of measurements, it was necessary to send a measurement file to a computer that could calculate the heart rate estimations. Obtaining these values has allowed to draw conclusions about the accuracy and reliability of pulse measurement using a mobile devices.

Title: Haptic Perception of Virtual Spring Stiffness Using ExoTen-Glove

Abstract: This paper presents a study of haptic perception of virtual stiffness and the influence of visual feedback in virtual reality. In this study, a novel and lightweight haptic glove (ExoTen-Glove) based on Twisted String Actuation (TSA) system is presented and evaluated. This system has two independent TSA modules with integrated force sensors and small-size DC motors. ExoTen-Glove provides force feedback to the users during the execution of grasping virtual objects. The overall design, the controller and the preliminary experimental evaluation of the ExoTen-Glove have been shown in this paper. Different experiments have been performed in virtual reality environment using HTC VIVE headset with 2 degrees of freedom grasping tasks, squeezing a pair of virtual springs with the participant's thumb and index fingers. The aim of this study is to illustrate the benefit of using ExoTen-Glove to distinguish stiffness of a pair of virtual springs and the role of the visual feedback. The results show that the users use not only haptic cues but also use visual cues in detecting spring stiffness difference.

Title: Tiny TTCN-Inspired Testing Tools for Experimenting with Hybrid IoT Systems

Abstract: This work presents the design of a lightweight, low-end, virtually zero-cost on-line passive testing technology (Tiny TTCN-inspired Testing Tool) that is complementary to other, well established testing frameworks. A tester is built around an Arduino-class microcontroller and is programmed in a test language that re-creates the basic semantics and look-and-feel of the standardized test language TTCN-3 (Testing and Test Control Notation). It is intended for rapid prototyping and as a one-off development platform for the validation of IoT-class distributed systems involving humans-in-the-loop, especially for long-term unobtrusive supervision of in-the-wild behaviour change experiments in an instrumented home/work facility. To justify feasibility claims, selected implementation details are also reported.

Title: ReFlexeNN - the Wearable EMG Interface with Neural Network Based Gesture Classification

Abstract: The electromyographic activity of muscles was measured using a wireless biofeedback device. The aim of the study was to examine the possibility of creating an automatic muscle tension classifier. Several measurement series were conducted and the participant performed simple physical exercises - forcing the muscle to increase its activity accordingly to the selected scale. A small wireless device was attached to the electrodes placed on the patient's body in the area of biceps muscle. The patient body position, electrode placement and performed exercises were the features that as much as possible, minimized the impact of the surrounding muscles influence. The data were recorded and an analysis was made using QT /C++ environment. The exercises were designed to enable evaluation of muscle activity according to Lovett scale. The aim of the research described in this article was to help in the assessing of the muscle strength tension to assess progress in rehabilitation. The designed feed-forward neural network allowed classification of recorded signals with 78% accuracy.

Title: Digits Recognition with Quadrant Photodiode and Convolutional Neural Network

Abstract: In this paper we have investigated the capabilities of a quadrant photodiode based gesture sensor in the recognition of digits drawn in the air. The sensor consisting of 4 active elements, 4 LEDs and a pinhole was considered as input interface for both discrete and continuous gestures. Index finger and a round pointer were used as navigating mediums for the sensor. Experiments performed with 5 volunteers allowed to record 300 examples of each digit from 0 to 9, which were drawn in the air. Digits were converted from a list of recorded coordinates into images processed as in the MNIST database. Three approaches for recognition of digits recorded by quadrant photodiode were considered: convolutional neural network trained only on examples from the MNIST database, network trained on mixed data of MNIST with examples recorded using quadrant photodiode (4/1 proportions) and trained on the MNIST with examples recorded using the elaborated sensor but after the arbitral rejection of 20% of worst quality data (4/1 proportions preserved). The application of the third approach in comparison to the first one allowed to increase the overall accuracy of digits classification from 34.4% to 86% for testing data recorded with the use of the pointer and from 32% to 81.2% for data recorded with the use of a finger (for 50Hz sampling frequency).

Title: Extracting Concepts from the Software Requirements Specification Using Natural Language Processing

Abstract: Extracting concepts from the software requirements is one of the first step on the way to automating the software development process. This task is difficult due to the ambiguity of the natural language used to express the requirements specification. The methods used so far consist mainly of statistical analysis of words and matching expressions with a specific ontology of the domain in which the planned software will be applicable. This article proposes a method and a tool to extract concepts based on a grammatical analysis of requirements written in English without the need to refer to specialized ontology. These concepts can be further expressed in the class model, which then can be the basis for the object-oriented analysis of the problem. This method uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to recognize parts of speech and to divide sentences into phrases and also the WordNet dictionary to search for known concepts and recognize relationships between them.

Title: Context-Based Multimodal Output for Human-Robot Collaboration

Abstract: Research on multimodal systems for human-robot interaction mostly focuses on the processing of inputs. Yet, the output is equally important: A robot that is able to use different modalities in an interaction appears more natural and can be understood more easily. In this paper, we present our multimodal fission framework, called MMF framework, which is a framework for incorporating planning criteria to select the most suitable set of modalities based on information about the interaction context. We describe our input and output layer, present an algorithm for an automated selection of suitable attributes for referencing objects verbally as well as a simple assessment of the suitability of pointing gestures in the given context. Furthermore, we describe a new approach for the modality and device selection as formulation of constraint optimization problems. In the end, we will report the results of a user study, which has been conducted to evaluate the generated multimodal output.

Title: BandReader - A Mobile Application for Data Acquisition from Wearable Devices in Affective Computing Experiments

Abstract: As technology becomes more ubiquitous and pervasive, special attention should be given to human-computer interaction, especially to the aspect related to the emotional states of the user. However, this approach assumes very specif c mode of data collection and storage. This data is used in the affective computing experiments for human emotion recognition. In the paper we describe a new software solution for mobile devices that allows for data acquisition from wristbands. The application reads physiological signals from wristbands and supports multiple recent devices. In our work we focus on the Heart Rate (HR) and Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) readings. The recorded data is conveniently stored in CSV files, ready for further interpretation. We provide the evaluation of our application with several experiments. The results indicate that the BandReader is a reliable software for data acquisition in affective computing scenarios.

Title: Information Display Around Eyes Using the Vibration of SMA Wires and its Evaluation of Perceived Sensation

Abstract: Shape-memory alloys (SMAs) are metal which have the shape memory effects. By forming them to thin wires, they can shrink at a certain temperature; and then extend to original length after cooling below this temperature, thus shape-memory effect is observed. When pulse current is applied to a SMA wire, Joule heat generated inside makes the wire shrink about 5% of its length, and returns to the origin length when the pulse stops, which generate vibration in accordance with the frequency of the current. A novel designed actuator using the vibration of two SMA wires is proposed in this paper. The actuator has compact size and low energy consumption of milliwatts order. Tactile sensation is one of the important ways in human's five senses, which are used to acquire information from surrounding environment. In this paper, we are trying to transmit recognized information by translating it to tactile sensation perceived by skin around eyes. We divide the skin area around eyes into 4 zones, and design two tactile display prototypes. By installing multiple actuators in prototypes and applying pulse signals with different parameters, we conduct experiments to find optimal driving parameters to generate tactile sensation in designated skin areas. The higher-level perception in these area is tested by combining different parameters and stimulation patterns. Finally, information transmission is evaluated by the feedback from subjects and it turns out the proposed system performs well. In the final part we also propose potential applications of this system.

Title: A Vision and Speech Enabled, Customizable, Virtual Assistant for Smart Environments

Abstract: Recent developments in smart assistants and smart home automation are lately attracting the interest and curiosity of consumers and researchers. Speech enabled virtual assistants (often named smart speakers) offer a wide variety of network-oriented services and, in some cases, can connect to smart environments, thus enhancing them with new and effective user interfaces. However, such devices also reveal new needs and some weaknesses. In particular, they represent faceless and blind assistants, unable to show a face, and therefore an emotion, and unable to `see' the user. As a consequence, the interaction is impaired and, in some cases, ineffective. Moreover, most of those devices heavily rely on cloud-based services, thus transmitting potentially sensitive data to remote servers. To overcome such issues, in this paper we combine some of the most advanced techniques in computer vision, deep learning, speech generation and recognition, and artificial intelligence, into a virtual assistant architecture for smart home automation systems. The proposed assistant is effective and resource-efficient, interactive and customizable, and the realized prototype runs on a low-cost, small-sized, Raspberry PI 3 device. For testing purposes, the system was integrated with an open source home automation environment and ran for several days, while people were encouraged to interact with it, and proved to be accurate, reliable and appealing.

Title: Impact of Shifting Time-Window Post-Processing on the Quality of Face Detection Algorithms

Abstract: We consider binary classification algorithms, which operate on single frames from video sequences. Such a class of algorithms is named OFA (One Frame Analyzed). Two such algorithms for facial detection are compared in terms of their susceptibility to the FSA (Frame Sequence Analysis) method. It introduces a shifting time-window improvement, which includes the temporal context of frames in a post-processing step that improves the classification quality. Error measures are proposed to express the frame-wise accuracy of classifying algorithms, as well as the segmentation of the result sequences which they produce. The two compared algorithms, after applying the FSA improvement, perform better in terms of all the considered measures. The performed experiments have allowed to draw conclusions regarding preferred methods of measuring accuracy of such algorithms and the selection of suitable classification algorithms for being improved. In the end of the work, the resulting future possibilities of further developing the FSA methods are noted.

Title: Concept Verification of Ungrounded Force Display Using Cam

Abstract: Currently, various force display device are under development. There are two types of devices in terms of mounting method: grounded and ungrounded. The conventional grounded type force display device can accurately present the force by mounting on the desk or floor, but the movable range is limited. The ungrounded type device is wearable type, the user is burdened to some extent and there is a great restriction on force display. In order to solve this problem, the force display device that can be handled in the hand using a slider crank mechanism has been proposed. This device uses human sensory characteristics, and force can be presented by asymmetric acceleration motion. Since this device uses rotating bodies and crank mechanisms, there is room for improvement in terms of size and weight. Therefore, we adopted a cam to generate asymmetric acceleration motion for the improvement. By using cams, it is possible to reduce the number of devices and downsize them. In this paper, we propose the mechanism using cam and confirm the realization of left-right asymmetric acceleration motion for force display. In addition the performance of the force display was confirmed through both experiments: quantitative and subjective.

Title: Kinect Depth Recovery via the Cooperative Profit Random Forest Algorithm

Abstract: The depth map captured by Kinect usually contain missing depth data. In this paper, we propose a novel method to recover the missing depth data with the guidance of depth information of each neighborhood pixel. In the proposed framework, a self-taught mechanism and a cooperative profit random forest (CPRF) algorithm are combined to predict the missing depth data based on the existing depth data and the corresponding RGB image. The proposed method can overcome the defects of the traditional methods which is prone to producing artifact or blur on the edge of objects. The experimental results on the Berkeley 3-D Object Dataset (B3DO) and the Middlebury benchmark dataset show that the proposed method outperforms the existing method for the recovery of the missing depth data. In particular, it has a good effect on maintaining the geometry of objects.

Title: The Gricean Maxims of Quantity and of Relation in the Turing Test

Abstract: Previous research in the field of cognitive science has demonstrated the relevance of measuring reaction times to describe the cognitive cost of processing information, yet it has seldom been studied in the context of conversations and, to our knowledge, never in free flowing, interactive conversations. This study presents a way of analyzing entire online conversations in a protocol inspired by the Turing Test to investigate the relation between violations of Grice's Cooperation Principle and the response times of the participants. We hypothesized that response times are directly correlated to the cognitive cost required to generate implicatures from a statement. Our results show that violations of the maxim of Relation significantly increased the response time, especially for female participants. This confirms that measuring response times during a conversation can be a simple and relevant way of inferring the cognitive cost of processing an utterance.

Title: Multi-Agent Social Choice Model and Some Related Questions

Abstract: Agent-based modeling is widely used to support decisions in social, political, or economic settings. Despite many significant contributions, there is still a need for a model that could more holistically present wishes of the population using the aggregating individual preferences. Studying the philosophical and psychological concepts of social choice policy, we deduce a model of the agent taking into account the pro-social characteristics, risk aversion, and social state. The introduction of individual decision-making mechanism allows on the description dynamics of the society by the ODE's system. The simulation results and results of qualitative analysis of the system dynamics give the possibilities to answer the question on the tendencies in social preferences in population.

Title: SEKO: Smart System for Assisting Home-Based Rehabilitation of Knee Arthroplasty Patients

Abstract: Knee arthroplasty is a surgical procedure that replaces severely arthritic or damaged knee joints. After undergoing this commonly performed procedure, there are still some patients who never fully recover. One of the reasons is the lack of patient compliance to the prescribed rehabilitation schedule. This paper describes the development of SEKO, a smart system which has the goal of improving the compliance of patients to the rehabilitation schedule after a knee arthroplasty. This is done by providing a system which connects a smart brace to a patient and his/her physiotherapist. The system exists out of three parts: the smart brace which uses multiple sensors that gather data of the movements and exercises performed by the patient, the mobile application which uses the gathered data to give feedback to the patient, and the web application which uses the data to keep the patient's physiotherapist up to date on the rehabilitation performance and progress of the patient. The result is a proof of concept in the form of a fully functioning prototype, which was preliminary evaluated on the technical aspects and the usage scenario.

Title: Division of Road Traffic Network Based on Genetic Algorithm and Graph Coarsening

Abstract: In this paper, an efficient method for road traffic network division is described. The method is based on the dividing genetic algorithm and utilizes graph coarsening to improve its results. The main idea is to coarse the original road traffic network to obtain a smaller (i.e., coarser) network. This coarser network can be optimally divided and this division can be projected to the original network. Using the coarsening (based on geographical positions of the crossroads), the division method is faster and yields better road traffic network divisions. This is demonstrated directly on a distributed road traffic simulation, for which the division of road traffic network is performed.

Title: Using Wearable Electronics to Estimate Usefulness of Heart Rate Variability for Bathing Person Identif Cation

Abstract: In this paper the possibility of person identification based on biosignal is investigated. The work focus on the analysis of the changes in intervals between successive R-waves of electrocardiogram (ECG) recorded by wearable electronics in form of a necklaces. The main idea behind this project is to find efficient tool which may prevent sudden consciousness loss episodes or even sudden death episodes related to rapid temperature changes. Proposed method relays on the estimation of the RR interval changes in time with three approximation functions. Then, the identification of a person is performed based on the parameters of the utilized estimation functions.

Title: A Dancing Robot Controlled by a Guitar Sound

Abstract: This paper discusses an amusement content in which a robot dances in response to an electric guitar sound played by the guitarist. In our system, the motion of the robot changes according to the guitar performance, and simultaneously, the performer changes his ad-lib by receiving the stimulus from the robot motion and its acoustic percussion sound. In other words, our system realizes a so-to-speak jam session that can give an interactive music stimulus between the performer and robot. The main technical subject of this research is a method of determining an appropriate function from the guitar sound to the robot motion. Our system can extract various guitar sound features from the electric guitar sound. Based on the features, appropriate motions are selected from a motion database prepared in advance. The selection is based on the evaluation result of the audience who have seen the performance. Specifically a neural network that can output the correct answer is constructed by giving a set of highly evaluated sound and motion as training data. We introduce the results of experiments with a 6 degree-of-freedom animal robot holding a maracas by the hand.

Abstract: The paper is dedicated to proposing and evaluating a number of convolutional neural network architectures for calculating a multiple regression on 3D coordinates of human body joints tracked in a single low resolution depth image. The main challenge was to obtain a high precision in case of a noisy and coarse scan of the body, as observed by a depth sensor from a large distance. The regression network was expected to reason about relations of body parts based on depth image, and to extract locations of joints. The method involved creation of a dataset with 200,000 realistic depth images of a 3D body model, then training and testing numerous CNN architectures. The results are included and discussed. The achieved accuracy was similar to a reference Kinect algorithm results, with a great advantage of fast processing speed and significantly lower requirements on sensor resolution, as it used 100 times less pixels than Kinect depth sensor.

Title: Evaluating Asymmetric N-Grams as Spell-Checking Mechanism

Abstract: Typical approaches to string comparing marks two strings as either different or equal without taking into account any similarity measures. Being able to judge similarity is however required for spelling error corrections, as we want to f nd the best match for a given word. In this paper we present a bi2quadro-grams method for spelling errors correction. The method proposed uses different n-grams dimension for the source (checked) and target (from the dictionary) words. For different types of errors proper weights were introduced. This way an increase in the quality and performance of the algorithm can be observed and the method becomes dedicated to the task of spelling errors correction. The results obtained so far suggest that the method is a viable solution competitive to other currently used approaches. The paper presents the proposed method, test suite and experimental results. Some discussion is also presented.

Title: Configurable Virtual Reality Store with Contextual Interaction Interface

Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the problem of building configurable virtual reality environments, with a particular focus on user interaction allowing convenient creation and exploration of such spaces. The use of a novel Contextual Semantic Interaction Interface is proposed, which is dynamically adapted in real time to a particular context of interaction. We also present a modular design of a VR shopping space, which may be configured with the presented approach. The shopping space is created dynamically as a combination of three elements: exposition model, product models, and virtual store configuration. The first element visually reflects an existing or planned 3D store layout and is designed by an architect or a 3D modeling expert. The second element provides 3D models of particular products that can be presented in the exposition. The third elements is a configuration file, which connects the two previous elements. The presented configurable VR shopping space may be used to perform various types of research experiments in the fields of merchandising and e-commerce.

Title: Hand Rehabilitation via Gesture Recognition Using Leap Motion Controller

Abstract: This paper presents an approach for monitoring exercises of hand rehabilitation for past stroke patients. The developed solution uses a Leap Motion controller as hand-tracking device and embeds a supervised Machine Learning methodology. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used in order to assess the correctness of a set of simple rehabilitation exercises performed with a single hand. The basic SVM model was extended with particular interest for defining feature vectors in a continues environment. The proposed method incorporated leap motion data, normalization of angles and gesture recognition. A software system was developed to provide patients with a set of exercise corrections and guidance for rehabilitation.

Title: Objectivization of Phonological Evaluation of Speech Elements by Means of Audio Parametrization

Abstract: This study addresses two issues related to both machine- and subjective-based speech evaluation by investigating five phonological phenomena related to allophone production. Its aim is to use objective parametrization and phonological classification of the recorded allophones. These allophones were selected as specifically difficult for Polish speakers of English: aspiration, final obstruent devoicing, dark lateral /l/, velar nasal and pre-fortis clipping. A set of audio features based on mechanism of each phonological process was created. Recordings of phonetic material prepared by phonology expert were executed. First, several speakers were recorded while reading words from a teleprompter. Then, every word was played back from the previously recorded sample read by a phonology expert and each examined speaker repeated a particular word trying to imitate correct pronunciation. The next step consisted in partitioning by editing two recorded sets of words into allophones, then signals were analyzed and subsequently audio excerpts were parametrized. The comparison of two sets of allophones was reinforced by the phonology expert's assessment of produced speech sounds. Analyses presented in this paper allowed for discovering a set of parameters, which enable to determine whether the target processes were pronounced correctly.

Title: Application of Different Kinds of Interfaces in Modern Devices for Taking Care of People

Abstract: Taking care of those who need help is the cornerstone of our society. Thanks to the constant advances we have access to a better and cheaper technology that can make our daily lives easier, so why not apply the same concepts to help us in taking care of our loved ones. In this article we present concepts of systems, built using commercially available devices, for simplifying and automating the monitoring of children behaviour, as well as health of the elderly and chronically ill people. By using off-the-shelf commodity devices (such as Smart TVs, fitness trackers and accessories for game consoles) we can reduce the cost of such systems and make them more affordable.

Title: EEG Measures of Auditory and Tactile Stimulations in Computer Vision Based Sensory Substitution System for Visually Impaired Users

Abstract: Any kind of a sensory substitution device designed as an assistive technology for a particular group of users must address a very important question: what senses should be utilized as well as how to design and optimize the stimulation patterns? Various measures can be applied in order to estimate the quality of the proposed solution: one can measure the length of the training process, scores and navigation times in various use case scenarios, evaluate the cognitive load of the system, design surveys and questionnaires for the users, etc. Unfortunately, as the human brain and sensory substitution problem are both very complex, there is no single, true quantitative and qualitative method that can be used to compare different solutions. In the studies presented in this article, isolated responses to external auditory and tactile sensory stimulation events, their parameters and features are measured in a series of cognitive experiments and confronted with individual preferences of the visually impaired (VIP) and normally sighted (NSP) users.

Title: Electrical Propterties of Solution Mixtures for Bath Supervision in Ambient Assisted Living

Abstract: Impedance properties of bath solution are compared. Any ingredient such as soap, shampoo or bathing salt changes bath-solution's electrical properties eg. impedance. We have measured and analysed influence of typical bathing ingredients on electrical properties of the solution. We investigate impedance changes over frequency range from 100Hz tu 100kHz as it is most applicable for person detection. Electrical properties of bath solution knowledge is essential for person detection and biosignal acquisition of bathing person.

Title: Ambient Assisted Living Ecosystem for Supporting Senior Citizens' Human System Interaction

Abstract: Europe faces a major demographic shift which necessitates the development of relevant technology -based care services with support for telemedicine, telecare, ambient assisted living, and pervasive health concepts and technologies. There are already countless relevant platforms and components available that may be reused to become part of new ecosystems for supporting new services for improved human system interaction. The CAMINO Ecosystem, developed as part of the European CAMI project, aims at providing a framework and reference implementation of a vendor agnostic ecosystem built on existing platforms and components. Specifically, the CAMINO Ecosystem aims at identifying which existing technological building blocks are needed and available for creating such an open and agnostic ecosystem for supporting optimal human system interaction without being tied to a single vendor. CAMINO should be seen as a conceptual ecosystem, that relies on third-party frameworks, platforms, and components, and which is intended to evolve over time. The aim of this short paper is to present the CAMINO Ecosystem and the building blocks it consists of in order to showcase a fully functional ambient assisted living ecosystem offering novel human system interaction components. We present the preliminary experiences gained and discuss future relevant developments.

Title: GymApp: A Real Time Physical Activity Trainner on Wearable Devices

Abstract: Technological advances are pushing into the mass market innovative wearable devices featuring increasing processing and sensing capacity, non-intrusiveness and ubiquitous use. Sensors built-in those devices, enable acquiring different types of data and by taking advantage of the available processing power, it is possible to run intelligent applications that process the sensed data to offer added-value to the user in multiple domains. Although not new to the modern society, it is unquestionable that the present exercise boom is rapidly spreading across all age groups. However, in a great majority of cases, people perform their physical activity on their own, either due to time or budget constraints and may easily get discouraged if they do not see results or perform exercises inadequately. This paper presents an application, running on a wearable device, aiming at operating as a personal trainer that validates a set of proposed exercises in a sports session. The developed solution uses inertial sensors of an Android Wear smartwatch and, based on a set of pattern recognition algorithms, detects the rate of success in the execution of a planned workout. The fact that all processing can be executed on the device is a differentiator factor to other existing solutions.

Title: Autonomous Vehicle Navigation in Dense Urban Area in Global Positioning Context

Abstract: Over 50 percent of the world's population lives in urban areas today, the proportion is expected to increase to nearly 70 percent in near future. An autonomous vehicle services are likely to be adopted in dense urban areas. Some research prove, that autonomous transport might be capable of improving the transport needs of few times and as a consequence sustainability, congestion and safety may be improved. The world, hopefully is close to a transport revolution age. These studies are perhaps exaggerated, over-optimistic and far from fully operational, but the research direction should be noticed. A drone transport may be an evidence. The paper takes into account some aspects of autonomous vehicle navigation in a global context, that means in the context of Global Navigation Satellite Systems and introduce a new approach to a position calculation in the urbanized areas using that global navigational system.

Title: Motion Capture Technology as a Tool for Quantitative Assessment of the Rehabilitation Progress of Gait by Using Soft Orthoses

Abstract: The paper presents a research methodology concerning the progress of rehabilitation of children aged 3-6 with musculoskeletal disorders. The purpose of the study is both to perform the quantitative analysis of the gait of children and to verify if the soft orthosis improves their movement. For each child, experiments are carried out every three months. A passive optical motion capture technology is used as a tool to assess both the quality of gait and the progress of rehabilitation. On the basis of the obtained data, gait parameters are calculated with the use of specially developed algorithms and software. The analysed parameters concerning lower limbs are: step number, step length, step duration, gait velocity, maximum and minimum height of toes and ankles for both feet. The proposed methodology enables the quantitative analysis of gait improvement which may be treated as a supplement to the quality methods used by physiotherapists. The obtained results show improvement of analysed gait parameters.

Title: Predicting and Generating Wallpaper Texture with Semantic Properties

Abstract: Humans naturally use semantic descriptions to express their visual perception of textures; this is also the fact for perception and description of wallpaper texture. Classification of wallpaper's style is mainly based on understanding of visual information. However, the complexity of real-world wallpaper images is difficult to be captured by existing datasets. Inspired by a publicly available Procedural Textures Dataset, a number of wallpaper images was collected and assembled into a wallpaper dataset. A series of psychophysical experiments was performed to further collect semantic descriptions for this dataset. Each wallpaper was labeled with 5-10 semantic descriptions. More importantly, our dataset contains complex wallpaper images with rich annotations. To our best knowledge, our dataset is the first public wallpaper dataset with semantic descriptions. We use label distribution to analysis semantic descriptions and texture characteristics. Furthermore, a texture generation method based on GAN was tested using our wallpaper dataset, which produced state-of-the-art results.

Title: Speaker Recognition Using Convolutional Neural Network with Minimal Training Data for Smart Home Solutions

Abstract: With the technology advancements in smart home sector, voice control and automation are key components that can make a real difference in people's lives. The voice recognition technology market continues to involve rapidly as almost all smart home devices are providing speaker recognition capability today. However, most of them provide cloud-based solutions or use very deep Neural Networks for speaker recognition task, which are not suitable models to run on smart home devices. In this paper, we compare relatively small Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and evaluate effectiveness of speaker recognition using these models on edge devices. In addition, we also apply transfer learning technique to deal with a problem of limited training data. By developing solution suitable for running inference locally on edge devices, we eliminate the well-known cloud computing issues, such as data privacy and network latency, etc. The preliminary results proved that the chosen model adapts the benefit of computer vision task by using CNN and spectrograms to perform speaker classification with precision and recall ~84 % in time less than 60 ms on mobile device with Atom Cherry Trail processor.

Title: Feeling Your Way Around a CAVE-Like Reconfigurable VR System

Abstract: Virtual reality (VR) systems can generate environments that do not exist or are difficult to access. State-of-the-art VR is rapidly evolving and has resulted in enhanced user experience, which leads to a completely immersive experience. Advances in high-resolution displays and highly powerful computer graphics hardware drive the most substantial advancement in VR, which is the introduction of low-cost consumer-grade head-mounted displays (HMD). Despite being inexpensive and providing a high-quality VR experience, commonly used HMDs have a limited field of view, and giving multiple people access to the same virtual environment is inherently challenging. CAVE™ Automated Virtual Environments (CAVE) have benefitted from the same advances in computer graphics hardware and from improvements to binocular (stereo) projection technology, which has reduced the cost and complexity of such systems and increased the visual display quality (resolution, colour, frame rate, etc.). Unlike in HMDs, in a CAVE tracking system, interaction technologies and audio are distinct sub-systems that need to be designed to achieve the desired purpose. A designer needs to consider applications to be used in CAVE and optimise performance. In this paper, we present the design specifications of a reconfigurable CAVE-like VR system that incorporates 6-degree-of-freedom haptic interaction and 3D ambisonic audio. The system was designed for the Centre for Advanced Design in Engineering Training, VR Lab, at Deakin University. Future directions and different use cases along with a comparison matrix are presented to highlight the advantages of the presented system over other existing VR technologies.

Title: Positive Risk of Creativity in Software Projects: an Expected Result, a Threat or an Opportunity?

Abstract: Positive risk of creativity appears when there is an excess of creativity. This paper aims at exploring the concept of positive risk of creativity in software projects. It presents a taxonomy of positive risks as well as case studies of positive risks in diploma software projects. It also attempts to answer the question whether positive risks should be treated as expected results of applying creativity process, or they cause additional threats, or they can be treated as sources of opportunities. It appears that actually all options are possible depending on circumstances and each option requires a different approach to their management.

Title: Acoustic Data Building Toolset for Easy Experimentation with Neural Network-based Speech Recognition in Polish and English

Abstract: In this paper the CLARIN-PHONEREC toolset for the conversion of an acoustic corpus into the loadable set of Python binary arrays is described. The aim of the tools is to make it easy to start experimenting with automatic speech recognition using Python and neural networks libraries. To make initial experiments even easier, apart from the programs that convert any acoustic corpus to the binary shape, also the ready to use datasets for speech recognition experiments in Polish are provided and described here. By using provided tools and datasets, researchers are free of heavy labour related to speech sample conversion to train, development and test datasets. The provided dataset is created from the one of the biggest publicly available Polish speech corpora: CLARIN-PL. The tools presented in this paper can be also used to prepare phoneme recognition training and testing data in other languages, e.g. from the popular TIMIT dataset. In this way, experiment results for Polish can be compared to analogous results obtained for English.

Title: The 2SEES Smart Stick: Concept and Experiments

Abstract: Visually Impaired People (VIP) rely on white canes and not on Electronic Travel Aids (ETA), despite the more advanced features these offer. Part of the reluctance to use ETA may be due to their lack of reliability. The 2SEES system aims to be a reliable and easy-to-use ETA, integrating together several functionalities required for VIP to travel safely. This paper presents the new concept and prototype of the 2SEES and early experiments on its functionalities.

Title: A Mobile Application for Interactive Sonification of Images for the Visually Impaired

Abstract: The article presents a mobile application for interactive sonication of images, which is a tool supporting blind and partially sighted persons in interpretation of graphical content. The software can be used in blind education and in improving everyday life, work and entertainment. The article presents methods that facilitate interaction with the developed interactive sonification system and accelerate the teaching process, with a strong emphasis on customizing the user interface to the needs of people with visual impairments. A set of games that assist the user was created both to help with the familiarization with the available tools and to assess the progress made by the users. A test module consisting of a sequence of illustrations and prepared tasks was used to verify the effects of the exercises. The first positive results are reported of the empathic tests of the application in which normally sighted, but blindfolded volunteers have taken part.

Title: A Low-Profile Digital Eye-Tracking Oculometer for Smart Eyeglasses

Abstract: Wearable eye tracking devices have broad uses in medicine, psychology, augmented & virtual reality and consumer market research. Most mobile eye trackers available today utilize infrared imaging of the pupil and corneal reflections with video cameras. This tracking method requires sophisticated real-time processing of video signals consuming substantial electrical power. This method is thus unsuitable for light weight wearables such as adaptive smart eyeglasses for correction of presbyopia. In this paper we present a low-profile, low-power (7.7 mJ/sample) digital eye tracker oculometer based on infrared sclera tracking. The system is implemented using eight, 24-bit infrared proximity sensors and synchronous infrared LEDs. The pupil location is determined from 32 reflected pulsed light measurements independent of ambient illumination. The digital oculometer is 3.1 mm thick and weighs ~3 g. The tracker mounts adjacent to the tunable lenses in the smart eyeglasses frame. The eye tracker showed a pointing error of 1.3 degrees rms over a vertical and horizontal range of 30 degrees when tested by an observer.

Title: Radiologists' Gaze Characterization During Lung Nodule Search in Thoracic CT

Abstract: Lung cancer diagnosis is made by radiologists through nodule search in chest Computed Tomography (CT) scans. This task is known to be difficult and prone to errors that can lead to late diagnosis. Although Computer-Aided Diagnostic (CAD) systems are promising tools to be used in clinical practice, experienced radiologists continue to perform better diagnosis than CADs. This paper proposes a methodology for characterizing the radiologist's gaze during nodules search in chest CT scans. The main goals are to identify regions that attract the radiologists' attention, which can then be used for improving a lung CAD system, and to create a tool to assist radiologists during the search task. For that purpose, the methodology processes the radiologists' gaze and their mouse coordinates during the nodule search. The resulting data is then processed to obtain a 3D gaze path from which relevant attention studies can be derived. To better convey the found information, a reference model of the lung that eases the communication of the location of relevant anatomical/pathological findings is also proposed. The methodology is tested on a set of 24 real-practice gazes, recorded via an Eye tracker, from 3 radiologists.

Title: A Biofeedback System that Uses the Game to Study Electrical Muscle Activity

Abstract: The aim of this project was to design a system that will allow performing repetitive muscle exercises using a biofeedback device. It is supposed to enhance the motivation and attractiveness of the performed tasks thanks to an interactive game developed for mobile devices with the Android operating system. The built-in calibration mechanisms enable the users to play a game that is independent of their abilities which evens out the level of all players. The data in the form of EMG signal is gathered directly from the patient's body's surface in real-time and is sent wirelessly for further processing. While testing the system's efficiency, two types of calibration processes used in the mobile application were carried out.

Title: Towards Guidelines for Mental State Induction in First-Person Shooters

Abstract: In this paper we develop design guidelines for mental state induction in first-person shooters (FPS). To illustrate our design guidelines, we develop four versions of a first-person shooter video game each inducing a specific mental state on the player following our guidelines. We also conduct an evaluation using the self-perceived mental state of the participants as a metric to compare the mental state induced with each version. Results show that we were able to induce frustration, suggesting that further research is needed to fully understand the relation of gameplay and mental state inducement on FPS games.

Title: Towards a Simulation-Based Medical Education Platform for PVSio-Web

Abstract: Interface design flaws are often at the root cause of use errors in medical devices. Medical incidents are seldom reported, thus hindering the understanding of the incident contributing factors. Moreover, when dealing with a use error, both novices and expert users often blame themselves for insufficient knowledge rather than acknowledge deficiencies in the device. Simulation-Based Medical Education (SBME) platforms can provide appropriate training to professionals, especially if the right incentives to keep training are in place. In this paper, we present a new SBME, particularly targeted at training interaction with medical devices such as ventilators and infusion pumps. Our SBME functions as a game mode of the PVSio-web, a graphical environment for design, evaluation, and simulation of interactive (human-computer) systems. An analytical evaluation of our current implementation is provided, by comparing the features on our SBME with a set of requirements for game-based medical simulators retrieved from the literature. By being developed in a free, open source platform, our SBME is highly accessible and can be easily adapted to specific use cases, such a specific hospital with a defined set of medical devices.

Title: A Real-Time Terrain Ray-Tracing Engine

Abstract: Ray tracing is a rendering algorithm, capable of generating highly realistic images, typically employed in noninteractive applications that disregard real time performance and focus exclusively on image quality. As technological advances progressively improve GPU performance, many ray tracing algorithms have been proposed to render virtual scenes in real time with better quality than rasterization, which is more widely used in real time applications. Moreover, several works have demonstrated that ray casting is a feasible alternative to rasterization when it comes to terrain rendering. Based on an analysis of several terrain ray tracing algorithms, a real time terrain ray tracing engine was implemented leveraging those algorithms. The implemented engine does not require conversion from heightmap to polygonal meshes, employs a level-of-detail scheme based on the three-dimensional distance from the viewer and explores the use of secondary ray tracing for shadows in the context of heightfield rendering.

Title: Recognition and Use of Emotions in Games

Abstract: Facial expression and emotions recognition had attracted the attention of game developers and there are some game proposals, in which, by detecting faces, it is possible to detect who is playing and automatically load the players' profile. Likewise, the recognition of the players' facial expressions has been used to alter the expression of their avatars. In this work, we intended to study ways to use the recognition of a player's facial expression to change some parameters of a game, such as stimulate it when the player is bored or increasing its difficulty, for example, when it detects that the player is more stimulated and happy. This paper proposes a new approach for facial expression and emotion recognition, which divides the classification stage into two steps. First it is detected if it is a positive, a negative or a neutral emotion. Then it is applied a refinement step to recognize the particular positive (happiness or surprise) or negative (sadness, fear, anger or disgust) emotion. Our approach runs in real-time and was compared with the most common classification methods and has shown a great accuracy. We built a game to test our approach. The estimation of the player's emotional state was used to change certain parameters of the game, which increases or decreases the game difficulty.

Title: AGATHA: Face Benchmarking Dataset for Exploring Criminal Surveillance Methods on Open Source Data

Abstract: This paper outlines the development of a group of benchmarking datasets, using open source data, that provide useful information to improve the use of computer methods in tasks such as criminal control and surveillance. We aim to build a golden standard reference for developing computer vision systems capable of recognising possible criminal actions and, in consequence, given to the criminal investigation police the capacity to prevent them through faster action. We have explored, developed and fine-tuned Deep Learning models that demonstrated a statistical high performance in pattern recognition tasks such as: face detection (high accuracy specifically in gender detection and age interval determination), face recognition (people tracking and recognition on video sequences) and object recognition (i.e. cars and guns). In this stage, we present the first iteration through this set of datasets, where we present a dataset for age and gender recognition.

Title: Space Colonisation for Procedural Road Generation

Abstract: Procedural road layout generation has been traditionally approached using L-Systems, with some works exploring alternative avenues. Although originally conceived for biological systems modelling, the adequacy of L-Systems as a base for road generation has been demonstrated in several works. In this context, we present an alternative approach for procedural road layout generation that is also inspired by plant generation algorithms: space colonisation. In particular, we use the concept of attraction points introduced in space colonisation as the base of our approach to produce road layouts, both in urban and inter-city environments. As will be shown, the usage of attraction points provides an intuitive way to parameterise a road layout. Our method can also be used with flow-fields, demographics, geographical, and boundary maps to further fine tune the layout.

Title: Make Frame Rate Studies Useful for System Designers

Abstract: The effect of frame rate on task performance has been analyzed in various experiments. Unfortunately, it is still difficult for system designers to transfer these findings in real world scenarios. A first challenge are the mostly simplified experiments, which analyze a single interaction that does not necessarily fit to the complexity of a real world scenario. Secondly, the experiments often draw different conclusions when it comes to defining the “right” frame rate. In this contribution we propose and apply a method comprising three steps to generalize among experiments. Eventually this method is applied to find a suitable frame rate for a particular real world scenario.

Title: The Scope of Multisensory Experiences in Cultural Heritage Sites

Abstract: The use of technology in cultural heritage sites, like virtual reconstructions, has become a common solution to improve the communication between these spaces and their visitors. The amount of virtual information is flexible and it depends on what it is intended to transmit. Since humans perceive the world with different senses and in real-time, it is being noticeable the emergence of several applications using multisensory elements. Despite the implementations and related evaluations being scarce, the more recent studies depicts that this technology prize and enhance users' experiences when more stimuli are exploited. This paper presents a survey related to the recent studies made in this context, in order to identify the actual scope of multisensory experiences in cultural heritage sites.

Title: Using a multi-agent model to predict both physical and cyber criminal activity

Abstract: The paper describes a multi-agent methodology for the prediction of physical crime and cyber crime. The model uses clustering algorithms to determine the number of agents in the environment. The preference of each of these agents is determined by feature selection. The agents are allowed to interact in a synthetic environment. The results of the interactions are measured and the model is updated with new information. This modeling approach holds significant promise for the simulation of human criminal behavior.

Title: Adaptation techniques for intrusion detection and intrusion response systems

Abstract: The paper examines techniques for providing adaptation in intrusion detection and intrusion response systems. As attacks on computer systems are becoming increasingly numerous and sophisticated, there is a growing need for intrusion detection and response systems to dynamically adapt to better detect and respond to attacks. The Adaptive Hierarchical Agent-based Intrusion Detection System (AHA! IDS) provides detection adaptation by adjusting the amount of system resources devoted to the task of detecting intrusive activities. This is accomplished by dynamically invoking new combinations of lower level detection agents in response to changing circumstances and by adjusting the confidence associated with these lower-level agents. The Adaptive Agent-based Intrusion Response System (AAIRS) provides response adaptation by weighting those responses that have been successful in the past over those techniques that have not been as successful. As a result, the more successful responses are used more often than the less successful techniques. It also adapts responses based on the system's belief that intrusion detection reports are valid. Intuitively, adaptive detection and response systems will provide more robust protection than static, non-adaptive systems.

Title: Anticipatory planning in information operations

Abstract: The doctrinal definition of information operations (IO) focuses exclusively on offensive and defensive activities. The paper proposes extending the definition of IO to include information efficacy, then describes a new approach to military planning and execution called anticipatory planning. This approach seeks to merge planning and execution, and replaces reaction to events with anticipation of events, making more effective use of the information that is available during the conduct of military operations. The paper presents a methodology for the development of a prototype decision support system (DSS) for military decision makers, called the Anticipatory Planning Support System (APSS). This DSS facilitates in-depth analysis of the voluminous data that is available to military decision makers during the course of operations. The paper concludes with an example of the application of anticipatory planning to intrusion response operations.

Title: Optimal sensor management strategies based on the modeling of detection functions

Abstract: The authors consider the management of two heterogeneous sensors in a multitarget environment. The sensors are a radar and an infrared camera. They describe the first results of their work: the modeling of sensors, the determination of a criterion which takes into account all the parameters of the problem and the optimization of the criterion leading to the derivation of management strategies of both sensors. These results prove that this approach allows the determination of management for the sensors and also allows the derivation of performance of the management methods which could be used to compare several possible management strategies.

Title: Using speech to guide a mobile robot manipulator

Abstract: Mobile manipulators are mobile robot bases with at least one mounted robot arm which function in an integrated manner. A single arm mobile manipulator guided by speech commands is presented. The purpose of the mobile manipulator is to reach concrete locations in its environment and to pick up objects. The user can interact verbally with the system to help it localize and identify new objects, as well as incorporate them to its database of learned objects. The overall system is capable of recognizing speech commands, interpret them and execute the corresponding action. Human-robot interaction via speech has also been tested using different examples. Our approach supports the fact that the key to successful service robots is an adequate human-robot interface.

Title: A general ontology based multi-lingual multi-function multimedia intelligent system

Abstract: A large variety of information processing applications deal with natural language texts. Many of these applications require extracting and processing the meanings of natural language texts, in addition to processing their syntactic forms. In order to extract meanings from texts and manipulate them, a natural language processing system must have a significant amount of knowledge about the world and the domain of discourse. However, different kinds of knowledge are required for different languages, for different functions, and for different media. We design a new general ontology based natural language processing system referred to as the multi-lingual multi-function multimedia intelligent system (MMM-IS). MMM-IS is a complex system with multiple functions that can deal with multiple languages and multiple media. The general ontology consists of a static layer and a dynamic layer, and provides a real world knowledge model for the natural language processing system. The paper presents the concept of MMM-IS and how to build MMM-IS for real applications.

An essential component of the intelligent agent is a neuro-fuzzy inference engine that infers the current mode from sensor data and provides abstracted input for decision-making. The development of the intelligent system is structured around a nonlinear simulation of a conceptual V/STOL uninhabited aerial vehicle. We are incrementally adding capabilities to achieve a multi-faceted surveillance and combat-capable intelligent pilot-substitute.

Title: Motor fault detection using Elman neural network with genetic algorithm-aided training

Abstract: Fault detection methods are crucial in acquiring safe and reliable operation in motor drive systems. Remarkable maintenance costs can also be saved by applying advanced detection techniques to find potential failures. However, conventional motor fault detection approaches often have to work with explicit motor models. In addition, most of them are deterministic or non-adaptive, and therefore cannot be used in time-varying cases. We propose an Elman neural network-based motor fault detection scheme to overcome these difficulties. The Elman neural network has the unique time series prediction capability because of its memory nodes as well as local recurrent connections. Motor faults are detected from changes in the expectation of the feature signal prediction error. A genetic algorithm (GA)-aided training strategy for the Elman neural network is further introduced to improve the approximation accuracy and achieve better detection performance. Computer simulations of a practical automobile transmission gear with an artificial fault are carried out to verify the effectiveness of our method. Encouraging fault detection results have been obtained without any prior information of the gear model.

Title: An SVD-QR-based approach to fuzzy modeling

Abstract: An SVD-QR-based approach is proposed to design an appropriate fuzzy system directly from some gathered input-output data. A fuzzy system with fuzzy rule tables is defined to approach the input-output pairs of an identified system. In the rule base of the defined fuzzy system, each fuzzy rule table corresponds to a partition of an input space. In order to extract the most important fuzzy rules from the rule base of the defined fuzzy system, a firing strength matrix determined by the membership functions of the premise fuzzy sets is constructed. According to the firing strength matrix, the number of important fuzzy rules is determined by singular value decomposition (SVD), and the most important fuzzy rules are selected by the SVD-QR-based method. Consequently, a reconstructed fuzzy rule base composed of significant fuzzy rules is determined by the firing strength matrix. Furthermore, the recursive least squares method is applied to determine the consequent part of the reconstructed fuzzy system so that a fine fuzzy system is determined by the proposed method according to the gathered input-output data. Finally, a nonlinear system illustrates the efficiency of the proposed approach to fuzzy modeling.

Title: Optimization of partial parallel interference cancellation (PPIC) factor in CDMA systems

Abstract: The paper introduces an optimized formula for the partial parallel interference cancellation (PPIC) factor in CDMA systems. This factor is introduced to decrease the biasing term, which appears in the brute force cancellation scheme, in which the cancellation is done totally. This operation degrades the system performance since the amplitude estimate in the early stages is not reliable, so in turn, the multiple access interference (MAI) estimate isn't reliable either, and the performance is degraded. We obtain a formula for PPIC bit error rate (BER) as a function of the PPIC factor F/sub k/, and derive a formula for an optimum F/sub k/ that minimizes BER. We introduce plots of BER to show the enhancement in BER when we use the optimum F/sub k/ at different system parameters.

Title: Linguistic dynamic systems and computing with words for complex systems

Abstract: This paper outlines a computational theory of linguistic dynamic systems for computing with words by fusing procedures and concepts from several different areas: Kosko's (1992) geometric interpretation of fuzzy sets, Hsu's (1987) cell-to-cell mappings in nonlinear analysis, equi-distribution lattices in number theory, and dynamic programming in optimal control theory. The proposed framework enables us to conduct a global dynamic analysis, system design and synthesis for linguistic dynamic systems that use words or linguistic terms in computation, based on concepts and methods well developed for conventional dynamic systems. This theory has significant potential for modeling and analysis of systems where model, goal, control and feedback are primarily specified in words or linguistic terms.

Title: Building observers to address fault isolation and control problems in hybrid dynamic systems

Abstract: Model based approaches to diagnosis for dynamic systems have been based on continuous and discrete event models. Systems that combine continuous and discrete behaviors, i.e., hybrid systems have been typically abstracted into discrete event models or approximated by continuous models with steep slopes so that existing algorithms can be applied for fault isolation tasks. This approach runs into problems when both discrete events and continuous behaviors provide vital diagnostic information. We propose a diagnostic methodology that uses hybrid models of the system to perform diagnosis.

Title: Evolving intelligent multiagent systems using unsupervised agent communication and behavior training

Abstract: Multiagent systems in which independent software agents interact with each other to achieve common goals, complete distributed tasks concurrently under autonomous control. Agent communication has been shown to be an important factor in coordinating efficient group behavior in agents. Most research on training or evolving group behavior in multiagent systems used predefined agent communication protocols. Designing agent communication becomes a complex problem in dynamic and large-scale systems. In order to solve this problem, in our previous research we proposed a method applying genetic programming techniques, in particular Automatically Defined Function Genetic Programming (ADF-GP) (K. Mackin and E. Tazaki, 1999), to allow agents to autonomously learn effective agent communication messaging. For this research we take this approach further and combine training of the agent behavior as well as the communication protocol. By training both behavior and communication we expect to further optimize the system performance. A software simulation of a multiagent transaction system is used to observe the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Title: Intelligent control and decision-making demonstrated on a simple compass-guided robot

Abstract: The paper presents the architecture and algorithms developed for Dom Dinis, a simple compass-guided robot built by the authors. This includes environment exploration, task planning and task execution. Environment exploration, based on repeating a reactive goal search, enables a progressive construction of a grid based map. Based on the (possibly incomplete) map, the robot is able to plan its tasks. The execution capabilities of the robot include exception handling. Essential to all these capabilities is the knowledge of the robot's position in the world. The position is computed based on tracking traversed distances and followed orientations. Orientation is given by a compass. Dom Dinis does not use wheel encoders at all.

Title: Stable extension control of nonlinear systems

Abstract: A design method for an extension controller is developed. The proposed adaptive extension control resulting from the direct adaptive approach is employed to directly adapt the gain parameter of the extension controller. Then the constructed controller can be best approximated to a given optimal control. Unlike a fuzzy controller, only one linguistic-like level is needed in the extension controller. An appropriate control law can be adapted to the output gain of the developed extension controller. The best merits of the proposed controller are that: (a) the number of adaption parameters is small; (b) the design algorithm is easily implemented. In addition, a maximum control is established to guarantee the system robust stability. The derivation shows that the proposed extension controller is stable in the sense of Lyapunov. Finally, a nonlinear system simulation example is applied to verify the effectiveness and ability of the proposed adaptive extension controller.

Title: Towards a paradigm for activity modeling

Abstract: Model Integrated Computing (J. Sztipanovits and G. Karsai, 1997) involves defining a domain-specific language that allows for someone to effectively program an environment at whatever level the modeling environment creator deems appropriate. We have taken several complex, heterogeneous systems that posed problems of needing integration and requiring frequent reconfiguration at very high levels. The paper discusses: gathering the specifications for these systems, how the systems can be represented at these high levels in a paradigm also capturing the specifications, and then how reconfiguring this group can proceed. All of the activities constituting monitoring functionality and the resulting decision making exposed by the information system are shown to have been solved through utilization of Model Integrated Computing techniques.

Title: Formal methods in PLC programming

Abstract: A detailed generic model of the control design process is introduced and discussed. It is used for surveying different formal approaches in the context of PLC programming. The survey focuses on formal methods for verification and validation (V&V). The varying works in this area are categorized using three criteria: the general approach (A) to the task (model based, constraint based or without a model), the formalism (F) (Petri net, automata, etc.,) used to state the formal description, and the method (M) (model-checking, reachability analysis, etc.,) used to analyze the properties. Based on these three criteria (A-F-M) a three letter code for V&V approaches is introduced. Some works from the multitude of V&V research are presented and categorized using this new system.

Title: A concept for the integrated process description, PLC programming and simulation using Petri nets: application in a production process

Abstract: Despite the development of a variety of PLC/DCS system programming tools and analysis methods, the programming and, more generally, the automation system synthesis approach still includes a significant degree of automation expertise, in order to overcome problems resulting from process complexity, inadequate process description or final application verification. For a more systematic design of the automation application, initial concepts and guidelines are proposed, based on the concurrent operation of a number of Petri-net based modules that are structured in the form of a cooperating network. This network can include modules ranging from the highest possible level of the application ("master coordinating module") to the finest levels of the individual equipment (e.g "motor" or "valve" modules). These modules include not only the traditional "automation" or "programming" modules, but also modules for the modeling of physical behavior of the system under automation, as well as fault handling elements. These concepts are demonstrated in an industrial application. The use of a unified Petri-net structure for the integrated description of the application facilitates the overall analysis, radically reduces the design, installation and re-engineering time and increases the flexibility of the system.

Title: PLCTOOLS: design, formal validation, and code generation for programmable controllers

Abstract: Strong timing requirements and complex interactions with controlled elements complicate the design and validation of software controllers. Different techniques have been proposed to cope with these problems during the different development steps: for example, differential equations for modeling controlled elements, the IEC 1131-3 notations for designing the software controller, and formal models for validating the design, but no definitive solutions have been proposed yet. The paper describes PLCTOOLS, a toolbox that exploits all the aforementioned techniques to supply an integrated environment for the design, formal validation, and automatic code generation of software controllers.

Title: Methods and tools to the verification of safety-related control software

Abstract: This paper gives a summary of a project which deals with methods for the proof of the demanded properties of user-written control software. Although these methods are based on formal methods they are covered with user-friendly interfaces. The document displays the modelling of a control system, which consists of a programmable logic controller (PLC), a user program and the environment. It demonstrates the description of the requirements for this system and it explains how we prove these requirements at the generated model.

Title: A knowledge-based method for validating specifications including open parts

Abstract: SET is a credit payment protocol on the Internet. The SET specification has open parts in order to flexibly cope with various users' business requirements (BRs). Security requirement (SR) is also a kind of business requirement. Due to such open parts of the SET specification, the currently provided compliance test is not sufficient for assuring interoperability, though this test can verify whether the implementation of products complies with the SET specification. The whole specifications of BRs are confidential. Even the parts of these specifications are initially unknown. They have to be gradually cleared, added and corrected during testing or validating the specification such as the SET specification having open parts related to the above specifications of BRs. By representing the error-related parts of BR specifications as knowledge and by incorporating it as the knowledge base of a prototype system, such prototype system can be rapidly generated and flexibly modified. By adding this prototype system to the common test bed for compliance tests and refining its knowledge base using the results of the interoperability test of each new product, the validation of specifications such as the SET specification having open parts became possible without exhaustive test of interoperability.

Title: Active contour models: application to oral lesion detection in color images

Abstract: This paper presents the application of active contour models (Snakes) for the segmentation of oral lesions in medical color images acquired from the visual part of the light spectrum. The aim is to assist the clinical expert in locating potentially cancerous cases for further analysis (e.g. classification of cancerous vs. non-cancerous lesions). In order to apply the conventional Snake formulation, color images were converted into single-band images. A number of different single-bands were evaluated including those resulting from the original and normalized RGB, perceptual HSI space, I/sub 1/I/sub 2/I/sub 3/, and the Fisher discriminant function. Examples of Snake segmentation results of oral lesions are presented.

Title: Towards the automatic verification of PLC programs written in Instruction List

Abstract: We propose a framework for the automatic verification of PLC (programmable logic controller) programs written in Instruction List, one of the five languages defined in the IEC 61131-3 standard. We propose a formal semantics for a significant fragment of the IL language, and a direct coding of this semantics into a model checking tool. We then automatically verify rich behavioral properties written in linear temporal logic. Our approach is illustrated on the example of the tool-holder of a turning center.

Title: Tool MKSF for acquiring super-function in Java

Abstract: We have paid attention to machine translation (MT) users for a few years, and found that most users prefer that the system is fast, inexpensive, easy to control and easy to update. This means that sometimes we do not need to aim the MT system at highly fluent translations. In fact, usually we cannot build an MT system which can achieve highly fluent translations. We propose a new MT paradigm called super-function based machine translation (SFBMT) to try to address the MT users' requests. SFBMT uses a super function (SF) to translate without thorough syntactic and semantic analysis as most MT systems usually do. The SF is a function that shows the correspondence between the original language sentence patterns and target language sentence patterns. One key point for building an SFBMT system is how to acquire the SF from the practical natural language phenomenon. We present a method for aiding the acquisition of SF from the parallel corpus, and describe the tool called MKSF. MKSF has been constructed in Java. An experimental MT system based on the proposed method has been built using Java and some translation experiments have been carried out.

Title: Life extension module for machinery diagnostic systems

Abstract: Machinery diagnostic systems detect and monitor faults but are unable to predict remaining life. The RiskMAN/sup TM/ process developed as one of the modules of the Neural Network System Health Usage and Monitoring System (NNS/HUMS), developed under JAHUMS contract administered by NSWC/CD, provides the means for converting the outputs of a diagnostic system into parameters usable in a set of life extension mathematical predictors. Loads and fault severity indicators are incorporated into a risk probability of survival [P/sub s/(t)] equation which varies over time as the machinery loads and faults vary. A measure of the machinery reliability [R(t)] is employed in the derivation of P/sub s/(t) and in modified forms as bases of comparison for P/sub s/(t). The lower confidence limit on R(t) and a safety level R(t) are used in conjunction with P/sub s/(t) to indicate alarm conditions. RiskMAM/sup TM/ techniques and mathematical models have been developed as put of the NNS/HUMS real time diagnostic system for Navy and Army military aircraft (Giuntini, 1997). The NNS/HUMS is a critical link in the transition from a safe life maintenance (SLM) philosophy to a condition-based maintenance (CBM) philosophy. RiskMAN/sup TM/ receives the output parameters from the neural network module which are load state, fault class, fault severity, fault probability and severity probabilities. Then it converts these parameters into meaningful information that will detect an imminent failure or will enable life of the system to be extended beyond its normal/typical overhaul time. Though being developed for military aircraft applications, RiskMAN/sup TM/ is also applicable to general industrial machinery.

Title: A discrete-time recurrent neural network for solving quadratic programs with application to FIR filter synthesis

Abstract: A discrete-time recurrent neural network is presented for solving convex quadratic programs. It is the discrete-time version of its continuous-time counterpart which was developed by J. Wang and H. Li (1994). Sharing the same characteristic with its continuous-time counterpart, the proposed discrete-time neural network could compute the exact optimal solution to a quadratic program without using any penalty parameter. However, the discrete-time version is more desirable in practical realization in view of the availability of digital hardware and the good compatibility to computer. The condition for the neural network globally converging to the optimal solution of a quadratic program is given. The neural network is applied to FIR filter synthesis for illustrating its effectiveness.

Title: Particle swarm optimisation for evolving artificial neural network

Abstract: The information processing capability of artificial neural networks (ANNs) is closely related to its architecture and weights. The paper describes a new evolutionary system for evolving artificial feedforward neural networks, which is based on the particle swarm optimisation (PSO) algorithm. Both the architecture and the weights of ANNs are adaptively adjusted according to the quality of the neural network. This process is repeated until the best ANN is accepted or the maximum number of generations has been reached. A strategy of evolving added nodes and a partial training algorithm are used to maintain a close behavioural link between the parents and their offspring. This system has been tested on two real problems in the medical domain. The results show that ANNs evolved by PSONN have good accuracy and generalisation ability.

Title: Dynamic rule graph drawing by genetic search

Abstract: The recent importance given to the integration of the user in a KDD (knowledge discovery in databases) process, which gives him the opportunity to direct his mining towards his own specific needs, requires the development of new highly interactive visualization tools. For graph based representation of discovered knowledge, this means that layout algorithms must dynamically take modifications into account. The authors present a genetic approach to draw a series of layered directed graphs which model relationships between association rules. We develop new problem-specific genetic operators and show that genetic algorithms are well-adapted to solve a multiobjective problem: meeting static aesthetic requirements such as minimizing arc crosses and preserving the "user's mental map" when a transformation is interactively performed on the graph. Experimental results are presented on several randomly generated series of graphs.

Title: Complexity reduction of singleton based neuro-fuzzy algorithm

Abstract: During the past few years, efficient singular value-based complexity reduction tools have been developed for fuzzy logic techniques. The paper introduces a singular value-based reduction method to the generalised type neural network. The method conducts singular value decomposition of the weighting functions defined on the connections among the neurons and generates certain linear combinations of the original weighting functions to form a new connection-net for the complexity reduced neural network.

Title: Sensitivity analysis of multilayer perceptron to input perturbation

Abstract: An important issue in the design and implementation of neural networks is the sensitivity of neural network output to parameter perturbations. Past research in this area has focused on network sensitivity analysis after training. Very few research projects have considered sensitivity analysis as a design issue prior to network implementation. The authors discuss the sensitivity of the most popular and general feedforward networks (multilayer perceptron (MLP)) to its input perturbation. The sensitivity is defined as the mathematical expectation of output errors of the MLP arising from input error with respect to all input and weight values in a given continuous interval. The sensitivity for a single neuron is discussed first, and an analytical expression that is a function of the input error is approximately derived. Then an algorithm is given to compute the sensitivity for an entire MLP network. The theoretical results of the derived formula were shown to agree with experimental results. By analyzing the derived analytical expression and implementing the given algorithm on a number of representative MLP networks, some significant observations on the behavior of sensitivity are discovered, which could be useful for network design consideration.

Title: Grammars and cellular automata for evolving neural networks architectures

Abstract: The class of feedforward neural networks trained with back-propagation admits a large variety of specific architectures applicable to approximation pattern tasks. Unfortunately, the architecture design is still a human expert job. In recent years, the interest to develop automatic methods to determine the architecture of the feedforward neural network has increased, most of them based on the evolutionary computation paradigm. From this approach, some perspectives can be considered: at one extreme, every connection and node of architecture can be specified in the chromosome representation using binary bits. This kind of representation scheme is called the direct encoding scheme. In order to reduce the length of the genotype and the search space, and to make the problem more scalable, indirect encoding schemes have been introduced. An indirect scheme under a constructive algorithm, on the other hand, starts with a minimal architecture and new levels, neurons and connections are added, step by step, via some sets of rules. The rules and/or some initial conditions are codified into a chromosome of a genetic algorithm. In this work, two indirect constructive encoding schemes based on grammars and cellular automata, respectively, are proposed to find the optimal architecture of a feedforward neural network.

Title: Justification-based belief maintenance using neural networks

Abstract: An implementation of justification-based belief maintenance using a Hopfield network has been proposed for relabeling belief graphs during belief maintenance. The paper analyzes the theoretical foundation of this work and discusses the source of representational and stability problems found in this system (called the Hopfield RMS). It extends that work by analyzing the advantages of a bidirectional associative memory and shows that the BAM is preferable to the Hopfield network for implementing justification based reason maintenance in intelligent agent belief systems.

Title: A two-stage algorithm for improved topography preservation in self-organizing maps

Abstract: It has been observed that the Kohonen self-organizing map (SOM) has two goals, which are pursued simultaneously in the standard training algorithm. The first goal is adequate vector quantization and the second is satisfactory preservation of topography between the input data and the output map. Vector quantization by the SOM is performed through the codebook vectors associated with vertices of the map grid, each of which represents a number of input data points. Topography preservation is achieved through the edges of the grid, which impose an output-space ordering on the (input space) codebook vectors. This paper introduces a new batch training algorithm for topography-preserving maps that approaches the two goals of the SOM independently. The algorithm is the outgrowth of a new topographical error metric that places greater emphasis on the preservation of relationships between global input data structures. Experimental results indicate that the two-stage algorithm substantially improves the preservation of global input data structures, although this improvement comes at the cost of an increase in the number of topological discontinuities on a local scale.

Title: Chaotic associative memory for successive learning using internal patterns

Abstract: The authors propose a chaotic associative memory for successive learning (CAMSL) using internal patterns. In the CAMSL, the learning process and the recall process are not divided. When an unstored pattern is given to the network, the CAMSL can learn the pattern successively. The CAMSL distinguishes an unstored pattern from the stored patterns. When a stored pattern is given, the CAMSL recalls the pattern. When an unstored pattern is given, the CAMSL changes the internal pattern for the input pattern by chaos and presents the other pattern candidates. When the CAMSL cannot recall the desired pattern, it learns the input pattern as an unstored pattern. We carried out a series of computer simulations and confirmed the effectiveness of the CAMSL.

Title: Stability of discrete Hopfield neural networks with time-delay

Abstract: It is well-known that discrete Hopfield neural networks (DHNNs) without delay converge to a stable state. Due to this property, DHNNs without delay have wide potential applications to many fields, such as associative memory devices and combinatorial optimization. A DHNN with delay, which can deal with temporal information, is a generalization of a DHNN without delay. This paper investigates the convergence theorems of DHNNs with delay, based on new updating modes. A new bivariate energy function is constructed which represents the relationships between application problems and DHNNs with delay. It is proved that DHNNs with delay converge to a stable state. These results extend the existing results corresponding to DHNNs without delay. We also relate the maximum of this energy function to a stable state of DHNNs with delay. Furthermore, we describe algorithms for DHNNs with delay in detail.

Title: A chaos associative memory with a skew-tent mapping

Abstract: The article proposes a chaos neural network model applied to autoassociation memory. The presented artificial neuron model is properly characterized in terms of a time-dependent skew-tent periodic activation function to involve a chaotic dynamics as well as the energy steepest descent strategy. It is elucidated that the present neural network has a remarkable performance of dynamic memory retrievals beyond that of conventional models with nonmonotonous activation function as well as a monotonous activation function (e.g., sigmoidal). This advantage is found to be attributed to the property of analogue periodic mapping accompanied by chaotic behaviour of the neurons. It is concluded that the presented analogue neuron model with periodicity control has an apparently large memory capacity in comparison with previously proposed association models.

Title: A novel dose-response model for foodborne pathogens using neural networks

Abstract: Foodborne infections are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in human populations. Risk assessment and public health control measures could be greatly enhanced by establishing an accurate relationship between ingested dose and infection, and defining minimum infectious doses. In this paper, a novel neural network model is proposed for the dose response of foodborne pathogens. The proposed model assumes a three-layer structure with a fast backpropagation learning algorithm. The model predictions for four available data sets from the literature are compared using six statistical models (log-normal, log-logistic, simple exponential, flexible exponential, /spl beta/-Poisson and Weibull-Gamma). The methods of least square error, maximum likelihood and correlation coefficient are used for the comparison, and they show that the neural network model does better than the statistical models. Predictions of dose response for multiple types of pathogens and with different host age and gender using neural network models are discussed, with simulations.

Title: Self-organization in probabilistic neural networks

Abstract: S. A. Kauffman (1993) explored the law of self-organization in random Boolean networks, and K. Inagaki (1998) also did it in neural networks partially. The aim of the paper is to show that probabilistic neural networks (PNNs) hold the order, even though the weights, the thresholds, and the connections between neurons are determined randomly; PNNs are recurrent networks and controlled by a probabilistic transition rule based on a Boltzmann machine. In addition, the deterministic transient neural networks (DNNs) which are the special networks of PNNs are studied extensively. From simulations, it is shown that in DNNs the dynamics follow the square-root law and there is another new critical point for the distribution of the thresholds. In addition, it is shown that in PNNs the averages of the Hamming distance between the attractors of DNN and PNN stay around a certain value depending on the thresholds and the gradient of the Sigmoidal function. These results can be explained by the sensitivity to the initial conditions of DNNs.

Title: Information theoretic rule discovery in neural networks

Abstract: Proposes a new information-theoretic method called structural information, and argues that this new method should be substituted for the traditional competitive method. Structural information control is a more powerful and biologically sounder model, because it uses a soft winner-takes-all model instead of a hard winner-takes-all model. Experiments were conducted to apply the structural information to linguistic rule extraction in which the choice of different donatory verbs must be inferred in an unsupervised way. We found that the structural information control can detect linguistic rules more accurately than the traditional competitive learning method.

Title: A visual nervous network for moving object recognition

Abstract: Proposes a visual nervous network for moving object recognition. This network is based on a visual neural net which has a hierarchical parallel structure. The network consists of three modules: the movement detection module, the moving object estimation module and the moving object recognition module. The movement detection module detects moving points and their direction. The moving object estimation module estimates the moving object based on motion features. The moving object recognition module recognizes the moving object based on its form feature. The network is able to recognize moving objects by uniting motion recognition and pattern recognition. We carried out computer simulations using real moving images to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed network.

Title: An intelligent pressure sensor with self-calibration capability using artificial neural networks

Abstract: The nonlinear response characteristics of a capacitive pressure sensor (CPS) changes when the ambient temperature changes widely. In such conditions, the calibration becomes difficult, and to obtain an accurate pressure readout, appropriate compensation of the CPS characteristics is needed. We propose an intelligent CPS using artificial neural networks (ANNs) to provide self-calibration and compensation. The proposed ANN model can provide automatic nonlinear compensation and calibration of the CPS characteristics. A microcontroller unit (MCU) based implementation scheme for this model is also considered. Simulation results show that this model can estimate the pressure with a maximum full-scale error of /spl plusmn/1% over a variation of temperature from -50 to 150/spl deg/C.

Title: Neural net based image retrieval by using color and location information

Abstract: A neural net-based image retrieval method is presented, in which color and location features are extracted from images. This method can retrieve similar images to a selected one from a large data set of color images. In particular, the location features in the color distribution of an image are important in the image retrieval. This image retrieval method extracts color features and their location information included in an image. A neural network tries to find images with similar features from a data set. First, images are translated into gray-scale ones and then are divided into eight regions based on gray-scale values. The color and location features are extracted from these regions after integration of regions. The RGB and HSV color values in each region, area, and the X- and Y-values in the orthogonal coordinates are learned by a multi-layered neural network. After learning, the neural network evaluates the similarity between a selected image and the other ones in the data set. The similar images found by the neural network are the retrieval results.

Title: Classification of sleep-waking states using modular neural networks

Abstract: Applies modular neural network models to classify sleep-waking states in infants. The performances of three connectionist models are compared: (a) a multilayer perceptron (MLP), (b) a mixture of experts (ME) and (c) a fuzzy ganglionar lattice (FGL). We propose a new methodology for enhancing neural classifiers based on input variable selection and confusion error analysis using expert criteria. The ME model was more robust than the MLP and FGL models in the presence of inconsistent or noisy data. Input variable selection and confusion error analysis using expert criteria led to parsimonious models with less parameters and better classification rates.

Title: An estimation of nonlinear time series with ARCH errors using neural networks

Abstract: The design of a neural network-based estimation system for nonlinear economic time series, based on the Volterra model, is presented. We use ECLMS (extended correlation least mean squares) algorithms as the noise cancelling method for nonlinear time series. The validity of the proposed method is demonstrated by estimating a high-order Volterra model with ARCH (autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity) errors. This algorithm has a good performance in solving nonlinear economic time-series estimation problems.

Title: Topology preserving using harmonic competitive neural networks

Abstract: Topology preservation is mainly used to analyze the structure of an input distribution. In some implementations, it refers to a data visualization process by means of which high-dimensional input data can be mapped onto a lower-dimensional space where the spatial features of the original input data can be visually revealed. In this paper, we propose a powerful topology-preserving method based on a self-creating model called the harmonic competitive neural network (HCNN). The HCNN is initialized as a triangular structure (i.e. three nodes connected to each other), as in the growing cell structure (GCS) of B. Fritzke (1994). In order to approximate the input distribution in a self-organizing manner, the training parameters are data-driven and the network size does not need to be pre-specified. Our goal is to map the topological structure of input data with less distortion error and lower computational cost in comparison with other networks, such as self-organizing feature maps (SOFMs) or topology-representing networks (TRNs).

Title: Reinforcement learning algorithm with network extension for pulse neural network

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new hierarchical pulse neural network and its reinforcement learning algorithm with network extension. The proposed pulse neural network has three layers, and all of the neurons are pulse neurons. This network learns relations between input pulse sequences and the desired outputs by updating connection weights and by adding neurons dynamically. We carried out a computer simulation to confirm the performance of the proposed algorithm.

Title: Adaptive neural activation functions in multiresolution learning

Abstract: The author extends original work on multiresolution learning (Y. Liang and E.W. Page, 1997; Y. Liang, 1997), and presents a new concept and method of adaptive neural activation functions in multiresolution learning, to maximize the learning efficacy of multiresolution learning paradigm for neural networks. Real-world sunspot series (yearly sunspot data from 1700 to 1999) prediction has been used to evaluate the method. The article demonstrates that multiresolution learning with adaptive activation can further significantly improve the constructed neural network's generalization ability and robustness. Therefore, the work demonstrates the synergy effect on network learning efficacy through multiresolution learning with neural adaptive activation functions.

Title: Mobile robot navigation using the mathematical model of the sensing system

Abstract: The paper presents a remotely controlled mobile robot able to work in an unstructured environment. The main constraint is represented by the communication time, which was evaluated of two orders higher than the inner clock of the control system. This difficulty has been avoided by giving a short-term autonomy to the system. Namely, the control system was configured as a neural network on board the robot that reacts to external stimuli. A copy of the network is in the remote control station. Here, a workstation periodically identifies the system dynamics, the robot environment and the optimal control strategy. The strategy is translated in a proper selection of the free parameters of the neural network. The values of these parameters are transmitted as remote control action to the robot neural network.

Title: A new neural structure with parallel and serial output via functional CPBUM neural network

Abstract: The authors propose a new neural structure with parallel and serial output via functional CPBUM neural network. Specifically, we combine the advantages in series to series and parallel to parallel to develop a parallel and serial output learning structure. Hence, the proposed model can reduce the computational complexity via the similarity analysis and sensitivity analysis. It is shown that the similarity analysis can be employed to determine the knowledge base of the controller. Furthermore, it is also shown that the sensitivity analysis can provide valuable information between input-output training pairs.

Title: An iterative divide and conquer modular neural network model

Abstract: Artificial neural networks have been successfully used in the areas of speech recognition, computer vision and nonlinear function approximation. However, one of the essential problems with the exiting neural networks is model selection. Model selection is a methodology for choosing the adequate size of a neural network model to learn a task, yet not compromising the neural network performance. The paper outlines a biologically and evolutionary plausible iterative scheme to overcome the problem of model selection for a newly proposed modular neural architecture network, the modified hierarchical mixture of experts model. The proposed scheme is constructive in nature and employs embryo-genetic principles to iteratively generate a modular neural network of adequate size to solve the problem at hand. The effectiveness of the proposed iterative scheme is demonstrated by applying it to a benchmark classification problem.

Title: Flexible link control using multiple forward paths, multiple RBF neural networks in a direct control application

Abstract: The article presents a control scheme that uses multiple radial basis function neural networks (RBFNNs) as a direct controller for a flexible link robot. Each RBFNN is trained to specialize in one type of movement and a logical switch determines which neural network (NN) will be active for each update time. Unlike most NN controllers, this controller will be trained offline and inserted after the output error drops to an acceptable level. By training the NNs offline, the update speed of the controller is increased. The goal of this design is to produce a highly accurate controller that can be easily and inexpensively implemented in industry. Simulation results are presented when the controller is tested with an aluminum alloy link driven by a dc motor.

Title: The application of neural networks to the analysis of dissolved gases in insulating oil used in transformers

Abstract: The state of insulating oils used in transformers is determined through the accomplishment of physical chemical tests, which determine the state of the oil, as well as the chromatography test, which determines possible faults in the equipment. The article concentrates on determining, from a new methodology, a relationship among the variation of the indices obtained from the physical-chemical tests with those indices supplied by the chromatography tests. The determination of the relationship among the tests is accomplished through the application of neural networks. From the data obtained by physical-chemical tests, the network is capable of determining the relationship among the concentration of the main gases present in a certain sample, which were detected by the chromatography tests. More specifically, the proposed approach uses neural networks of perceptron type comprising multiple layers. After the process of network training, it is possible to determine the existing relationship between the physical chemical tests and the amount of gases present in the insulating oil.

Title: Neuro-fuzzy classification of the new and used bills using acoustic data

Abstract: The proposed technique is based on an extension concept of an adaptive digital filter (ADF), a neural network (NN) with error back-propagation (BP), and fuzzy inference. Two-stage ADF is used in order to extract the desired bill sound from observation data in which the noise is included. The output signal of two-stage ADFs is transformed into spectral data by the fast Fourier transform (FFT), and it becomes an input pattern of the NN. Then, the discrimination result of the NN is finally judged by the fuzzy inference in a new bill or an exhausted bill. It is shown that the proposed technique is effective for the new and used discrimination of bill money for the experimental results presented.

Title: Chebyschev functional link artificial neural networks for nonlinear dynamic system identification

Abstract: An alternative novel artificial neural network (ANN) for the purpose of dynamic nonlinear system identification is proposed. The main drawback of feedforward neural networks such as a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) trained with backpropagation (BP) algorithm is that it requires a large amount of computation and the rate of error convergence is slow. The proposed Chebyschev functional link ANN (C-FLANN) is found to have much less computational requirement and its performance is found to be superior to that of a MLP for the complex task of nonlinear dynamic system identification, even in the case of additive input noise to the system.

Title: Neural-based control and stability of a nonlinear, non-autonomous, base-excited inverted pendulum system

Abstract: Presents a novel application of multilayer neural networks for online control of a nonlinear, nonautonomous base-excited inverted pendulum system. The pendulum has two degrees of rotational freedom and its base-point moves freely in the 3D space. The goal is to apply control torques to keep the pendulum at the desired orientation. Four three-layered neural networks are trained online, using the backpropagation technique, to approximate the unknown nonlinear pendulum. The networks are employed within a controller to represent the inverse dynamics of the plant. The requirement of training accuracy, to guarantee the stability of the closed-loop system, is established using Lyapunov stability theory. The examination of the proposed controller, through simulations, demonstrates the promise of the methodology and exhibits positive aspects which cannot be achieved by previously-developed controllers.

Title: Online modeling and prediction of a hydraulic force-acting system using neural networks

Abstract: Investigates the experimental modeling of the dynamic behavior of a force-acting industrial hydraulic actuator using a neural network (NN). Due to variable environmental stiffness as well as the characteristics of hydraulic components, the dynamics of the system is time-varying and highly nonlinear. It is therefore desirable to develop a nonlinear modeling scheme, based on NNs, to estimate and predict the output of the system online. In this paper, the predictability of an online-trained NN modeling a hydraulic force-acting system is first compared to a linear model. The result demonstrates that the NN outperforms its linear counterpart in terms of multi-step prediction. Then, a more detailed discussion of the online training of the NN is provided. The related aspects include the choice of the window length, the NN's structure and the criterion for terminating the training. The work studied in this paper should help in the design of appropriate force-control law and/or fault diagnosis algorithms.

Title: A GMDH network using backpropagation and its application to a controller design

Abstract: When designing control systems, it is necessary to make mathematical models which describe the controlled objects in detail. However, since the controlled objects generally have nonlinearities and uncertainties, it is difficult to obtain exact models. As an artificial network model, the group method of data handling (GMDH) scheme has been proposed. The GMDH network has a feature that the nonlinear dynamics are clearly expressed as a mathematical model. Therefore, it is relatively easy to obtain the system properties in detail. A new design scheme is proposed, which adjusts all weighting coefficients based on backpropagation. The newly proposed scheme enables us to obtain a mathematical model with superior approximation ability for nonlinear systems. Furthermore, the generalized minimum variance control (GMVC) system is constructed by using the proposed GMDH network. A numerical example for a process system is demonstrated to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

Title: An alternate radial basis function neural network model

Abstract: A new robust RBF neural network model is presented which, when compared with a conventional RBF neural network, has mathematically sound learning properties and better function approximation capabilities. The proposed RBF function uses log-sigmoid functions as the basis function which eliminate any risk of mathematical instabilities, as can be the case during the learning phase of Gaussian basis radial function networks. The performance of the proposed scheme is illustrated by simulation results of a nonlinear system identification problem. The results indicate that the proposed model performs well for nonlinear system identification problems.

Title: Modeling and identification of fertility maps using artificial neural networks

Abstract: The application of agricultural fertilizers using variable rates along the field can be made through fertility maps previously elaborated or through real-time sensors. In most of the cases previously elaborated maps are applied. These maps are identified from analyses done in soil samples collected regularly (a sample for each field cell) or irregularly along the field. Mathematical interpolation methods such as nearest neighbor, local average, weighted inverse distance, contouring and kriging are currently used for predicting the variables involved with elaboration of fertility maps. However, some of these methods present deficiencies that can generate different fertility maps for the same data set. Moreover, such methods can generate imprecise maps. Artificial neural networks have been applied for elaboration and identification of precise fertility maps which can reduce the production costs and environmental impact.

Title: A novel hybrid classifier for recognition of handwritten numerals

Abstract: A hybrid neural network and tree classification system for handwritten numeral recognition is proposed. The recognition system consists of coarse and fine classification based on a variety of stable and reliable global features and local features. For the coarse classifier: a four-layer feedforward neural network with backpropagation learning algorithm is employed to distinguish six subsets {0}, {6}, {8}, {1,7}, {4,9}, {2,3,5} based on the similarity of character's geometrical features. Three character classes {0}, {6} and {8} are directly recognized from ANN. For each of the last three subsets, a decision tree classifier is built for fine classification as follows: firstly, the specific feature-class relationship is heuristically and empirically created between the feature primitives and corresponding semantic class. Then, an iterative growing and pruning algorithm is used to form a tree classifier. Experiments demonstrated that the proposed hybrid recognition system is robust and flexible, which can achieve a high recognition rate.

Title: On the non-differentiability of fuzzy logic systems

Abstract: Tuning the parameters of fuzzy logic systems has become an important issue for their efficient development and utilization. Many techniques, mainly based on the application of gradient descent, have been applied to this task. The class of fuzzy logic systems using piecewise-linear membership functions (e.g., triangular or trapezoidal) and/or minimum or maximum operators possesses an error function that is non-differentiable (i.e., at any point in the search space) with respect to some of its parameters. Therefore the gradient does not always exist, and thus any convergence proof (even if only at a zero gradient point) no longer holds. The paper discusses the problem and shows some of the issues it raises.

Title: Boxing code for stroke-order free handprinted Chinese character recognition

Abstract: Many Chinese input methods rely heavily on the dictionary stroke orders of Chinese characters. Any deviation from the standard stroke orders in these methods would result in incorrect inputs. We propose a new coding scheme for handprinted Chinese characters, which allows stroke-order free input methods to be derived. In this scheme, each handprinted Chinese character is assigned an n-or-less-digit boxing code, which is derived from the box-like structure of Chinese characters. Each digit of the boxing code represents a unique stroke type of a given character stroke. Subsequent character recognition is then based on the matching of these boxing codes. Experiments were conducted based on 6 basic stroke types (t=6), and a boxing code length of 10 (n=10). Of the 300 characters we have tested, the boxing codes generated from both the dictionary and random stroke orders were the same for each character. The duplication rate was 5.6%. The results of the test indicate that boxing code is a feasible representation of Chinese characters. Although duplications exist, these could be reduced, if not totally removed, by taking in more stroke types. Further investigation is worthwhile in the fine-tuning of the two parameters t and n so as to obtain a more accurate and wider representation, and in the application of the new coding scheme.

Title: Improved handwritten digit recognition system based on fuzzy rules and prototypes created by Euclidean distance

Abstract: A method is developed to classify handwritten numbers based on prototypes created using Euclidean distance, weighted voting among closest prototypes and fuzzy rules to solve confusions. The set of closest prototypes is determined by an acceptance distance. The fuzzy rules use specialized functions to measure characteristics on the handwritten digits to determine whether a digit belongs to a particular class. Classification performance is compared among following approaches: closest prototype, weighted voting including linear and exponential weighting, and voting plus fuzzy rules. The method is also compared to an algorithm based on a multilayer perceptron (MLP) network with augmented training. The best classification achieved was by voting plus fuzzy rules (96.3/spl plusmn/0.4% for 11 simulations). This result compares favorably with those obtained by MLP on the same testing database (94.6/spl plusmn/0.5%).

Title: Employing multi-agents to identify touching of adjacent digits in handwritten Hindi numerals

Abstract: The paper addresses an important and vital problem within the general area of character recognition, namely the identification and recognition of touching in handwritten Hindi numerals. The basic idea is that while writing down numbers, it is possible to have adjacent digits touching each other. To handle this, we are developing a multi-agent system. So far, we have two agents, which are presented. The first agent works directly on the scanned image of the original handwritten number. It locates possible touching based on the thickness of handwriting. The other works on the thinned image. It segments the image into four categories of segments and tries to locate possible touching based on the rules that govern the connection of segments to form digits. After each of the two agents applies its own rules and investigates possible touching, and to increase touching recognition rate, the two agents negotiate and try to agree on the actual touching. The experiments carried out so far are promising and successful. The obtained results are very encouraging with a success factor of 92.70%.

Title: Selecting optimal personalized features for on-line signature verification using GA

Abstract: For signature verification, there can be a large number of features available in a signature. However, not all these features are of use as some even could be unfavorable for verification of particular signatures. Finding an optimal personalized subset of all the possible features for a signer is crucial for signature verification systems, which are based on a parameter approach. This paper proposes a novel automated optimal personalized feature selection method based on genetic algorithms. Feature vectors for a specific signer are encoded into a population of genes or chromosomes. Through a process of genetic evolution with the application of specific genetic crossover and mutation operations an optimized personalized feature vector is obtained. An important characteristic of the method is that the number and type of features obtained for each signer through genetic evolution is not fixed and predetermined. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of this novel approach to automated signature verification.

Title: Holistic handwritten word recognition using discrete HMM and self-organizing feature map

Abstract: A holistic system for the recognition of handwritten Farsi/Arabic words using right-left discrete hidden Markov models (HMM) and Kohonen self-organizing vector quantization is presented. The histogram of chain-code directions of the image strips, scanned from right to left by a sliding window, is used as feature vectors. The neighborhood information preserved in the self-organizing feature map (SOFM), was used for smoothing the observation probability distributions of trained HMMs. Experiments carried out on test samples show promising performance results.

Title: Improved segmentation and segment association for on-line signature verification

Abstract: Segmentation is a process that partitions a signature into different segments. This enables local characteristics pertinent to the signature to be extracted and subsequently compared. There are many variations in the choice of the segmentation technique depending on the underlying verification strategy. Immunity to intra-signer variations poses the greatest challenge to most techniques employed. This paper proposes a novel segmentation technique that chooses to segment signatures at relatively non-complex shape sections. Through the process of association, segments of an instance are matched with those of another instance to yield corresponding segments for local comparisons. An important aspect of the method is the reduction in sensitivity to intra-personal variations. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach to the segmentation of signatures.

Title: Exploring genetic programming for modeling character shape

Abstract: In the framework of an evolutionary approach to machine learning, this paper proposes to use genetic programming as a tool to implement a learning module whose purpose is that of finding the set of prototypes to be used by a handwritten character recognition system. After discussing the rationale behind this choice, we describe the structural character shape representation adopted and the coding scheme for transforming such a two dimensional representation into a vector-based one, especially suitable for genetic programming. Then, the basic principles according to which the approach has been designed are presented, together with the genotype's structure, the fitness function and the genetic operators devised to deal with the problem at hand. The results of a preliminary experiment performed on a standard database of handwritten characters are eventually reported.

The original image with 128/spl times/64 pixels is observed at the transaction machine in which rotation and shift are included. After correction of these effects, we select a suitable aria which shows the bill image and compressed image with 64/spl times/15 pixels to the neural networks. Although the neural network of the LVQ type could process any order of the dimension of the input data, the small size is better to achieve the fast convergence result. Thus, we have selected the above size of the image. Thirty-two bill images are in one set of the classification pattern of the experiment. The total number of data sets is 30 and 10 data sets are used for training of the network and the remaining 20 data sets are used to test the network. After training the neural network, 20 data sets are tested on how well the LVQ network could work. From the simulation results, the proposed method can offer suitable classification results for Italian Lira.

Title: Curve detection using a new clustering approach in the Hough space

Abstract: Detecting curves (straight lines, circles, ellipses, etc.) from an image is one of the basic tasks in computer vision. The Hough transform (HT) and its variants have been the commonly used curve detecting methods. However, quantization of the Hough space has serious problems ranging from loss of accuracy to detection of artifacts due to false alignments in the image. Researchers have applied cluster analysis to Hough space to tackle these problems; however, good clustering performance relies heavily on the correct number of prototypes for the curves in question. Since we do not usually have adequate prior knowledge on the input image, to achieve the required performance, we need a robust clustering algorithm that can explore the data structure adaptively during the learning process. We apply a new clustering approach to the Hough space to detect curves from a binary image. It starts from a single prototype in the Hough space. During the learning process, it splits adaptively into multiple prototypes that identify the regions of highest density. Our extensive experimental results show that our algorithm has great advantages, such as high accuracy, low storage and infinite parameter space.

Title: An extension matrix approach to Chinese character recognition

Abstract: Optical character recognition (OCR) provides a solution to acquire, archive and retrieve a large amount of paper-based information which is still commonly used in our daily life. The process of a classical optical character recognition system consists of a series of stages, such as format analysis, text segmentation, feature extraction and classification. This paper focuses on the last two stages, and two contributions can be claimed: first, rapid transformed stroke density features (SDF) are used for preliminary classification and outline primitive structural features for final classification. Second, the original extension matrix algorithm is improved by heuristic path searching on the basis of information entropy as well as Laplace error rate evaluation function. Our experimental results prove that the rapid transformed SDFs are insensitive to image translation or rotation, and that the improved extension matrix algorithm outperforms other inductive approaches based on AE1 and AQ15. The excellent performance with respect to a large data set also indicates our proposed approach is effective and efficient.

Title: Analytical decision boundary feature extraction for neural networks for the recognition of unconstrained handwritten digits

Abstract: Although neural networks have been successfully applied for the recognition of unconstrained handwritten characters, there have been few efficient feature extraction algorithms, resulting in inefficient neural networks. We apply a decision boundary feature extraction algorithm to neural networks for the recognition of handwritten digits and reduce the computational cost and complexity of neural networks. Experiments show that the proposed feature extraction algorithm can reduce the number of features significantly without sacrificing the performance.

Title: Optimization-based image analysis dealing with symbolic constraints using hierarchical multi-agent system

Abstract: The paper describes a method for understanding an image where desired objects have part-of relationships between them. This method is based on a hierarchical multi-agent system, where each agent takes charge of a desired object and tries to extract it using knowledge on its features. Since users can define this knowledge freely without any modification of the algorithm, this method is applicable to various problems of image analysis by changing the knowledge. Moreover, the agents in this system use symbolic constraints and evaluation measurements on the desired objects. They are defined in the knowledge each agent has and used to obtain the desired results where obtained objects are evaluated highly in terms of the evaluation measurements and satisfy their plausible relationships defined symbolically. To verify our method experimentally, we applied it to problems of line drawing recognition and character segmentation.

Title: A design of face detection system by using lip detection neural network and skin distinction neural network

Abstract: The authors propose a method to examine whether or not human faces are included in color images by using a lip detection neural network (LDNN) and a skin distinction neural network (SDNN). In conventional methods, if there are colors the same as skin color in scenes, the domain which is accepted as not only the skin color but any other color can be searched. However, first, the lips are detected by LDNN in the proposed method. Next, SDNN is utilized to distinguish skin color from other colors. The proposed method can obtain relatively high recognition accuracy, since it has the double recognition structure of LDNN and SDNN. Finally, in, order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, computer simulations were performed. First, 100 lip color, 100 skin color and 100 background pictures, which were changed into 10/spl times/10 pixels, were prepared for training. The validity was verified by testing images containing several faces.

Title: A fast object recognition system using object appearances

Abstract: The paper presents a novel appearance-model based fast object recognition system. The speed is achieved by avoiding much of the image processing required for feature extraction and by compactly representing object models in a subspace. Raw images of an object are transformed into an object model in an eigenvector space after a simple process that compresses the data size using a low pass spatial filter along with an interpolation method. The validity of the proposed scheme is demonstrated by a working model-airplane recognition system.

Title: Morphology-based front-view facial contour detection

Abstract: A new approach for detecting front-view facial contour is described. A novel contribution is to eliminate the ears and neck from the segmented face region by using morphological operations and knowledge about the face structure. Some consistent rules are derived from studying a large number of cases to locate some contour points from the skeleton of the skin-color segmented frontal face region. We extend our previous work (J.G. Wang and E. Sung, 1999), to solving face contour detection of tilted faces as well. The face contour can then be fitted as an ellipse using these points. The least inertia axis of the facial region is used as symmetry axis of the facial region that guarantees the facial contour can also be detected from a tilted face image. Experiments have been done with a number of images of a frontal view of the head including some with a slight pan obtained from an Internet face database. Also, a number of face images captured by a color CCD camera are tried using our method. The robustness is confirmed with a correct detection rate of over 94%.

Title: From continuous to discrete variables for Bayesian network classifiers

Abstract: Using graphical models to represent independent structure in multivariate probability models was studied over a few years. In this framework, Bayesian networks are proposed as an interesting approach for uncertain reasoning. Within the framework of pattern recognition, many methods of classification have been developed based on statistical data analysis. Belief networks were not considered as classifiers until the discovery that Naive Bayes, a very simple kind of Bayesian network, is surprisingly effective. The authors propose the use of belief network classifiers with optimal variables, i.e., networks which have to manage discrete and continuous variables.

Title: Knowledge modeling methods in the framework of evidence theory: an experimental comparison for melanoma detection

Abstract: The Dempster-Shafer theory, or evidence theory, is used in different fields such as data fusion, regression or classification. Within the framework of this theory, uncertain and imprecise data are represented using belief functions. Data fusion operators as well as the decision rule of this theory were largely developed and formalized. The aim of the paper is to present modeling methods of knowledge for the initialization of belief functions. Moreover, an experimental comparison of these different modeling methods on real data extracted from images of dermatological lesions is presented.

Title: Entropy based uncertainty measures for classification rules with inconsistency tolerance

Abstract: As an uncertainty data analysis method, rough set theory can be used to retrieve classification rules from the given data by partitioning the data according to the indiscernibility relations. The evaluation of uncertainty of rough classification rules needs some proper uncertainty measures. The uncertainty coming from the granularity of the partition includes inconsistency and randomness. Unlike the approximation quality of rough sets, the information entropy based uncertainty measures can deal with the two aspects of uncertainty. On the other hand, the noise in the given data can make the inconsistency overestimated. As a result, some originally consistent rules may become inconsistent and be rejected improperly. Inspired by variable precision rough set model, we construct two new uncertainty measures, which have some tolerance for the inconsistency of the data. Experimental results illustrate the fitness of them to evaluate the classification rules retrieved from the noisy data.

Title: A new view of the formal entropy as a measure of interdependence and its application to pattern recognition

Abstract: A novel entropic measure of interdependence among groups of objects is introduced, and applied to some clustering problems successfully. Most practical algorithms to carry out clustering tasks are based upon the notion of distance between two objects. For the purpose of taking 'more-than-two-elements correlation' into account, S. Watanabe (1936; 1969) introduced an entropic measure of similarity and cohesion among groups of objects, and proposed a method of interdependence analysis. His method has a number of theoretical merits, but sometimes it does not work. The article clarifies the nature of its difficulty, proposes a possible modification of the method, and discusses the advantages of the novel approach by showing examples.

Title: On exponential entropies

Abstract: As a number of information, an entropy has been defined as the weighted mean of a set of exponential functions involving the probabilities of a set of random events. The exponential entropy is claimed to have certain advantages over the classical Shannon entropy (C.E. Shannon, 1948). The article proposes two different generalizations of the exponential entropy, each of which represents a one-parameter generalization. Shannon's entropy is shown to be a particular member of one of these two new families of information measures. Some of the important properties of the new measures are discussed.

Title: Improved rule generation for a neuro-fuzzy network

Abstract: The success of a neuro-fuzzy network is influenced by both its architecture and its learning algorithm. Currently, C.-J. Lin and C.-T. Lin's (1997) FALCON-ART algorithm ranks amongst the best structure/parameter learning algorithms yet devised. The FALCON-ART algorithm is adapted for use in neuro-fuzzy networks responsible for pattern recognition tasks. In contrast with FALCON-ART, each cluster is issued with its own vigilance parameter. Consequently, the sizes of individual rule antecedents can be controlled. A fuzzy logic controller is employed for this purpose. When it was applied to the Iris recognition problem, the neuro-fuzzy network attained an average recognition rate of 95.07%. However, it fared slightly worse than a conventional neural network on a seismic discrimination task. The main advantages of the improved rule extraction algorithm are its speed, and the compactness of its resulting rule databases.

Title: Adaptive Bayesian classification using noninformative Dirichlet priors

Abstract: A model is developed to illustrate the effect that adapting correctly labeled training data with possibly incorrectly labeled data has on classification performance. The model is based on a previously developed model for mislabeled training data that uses the uniform Dirichlet distribution as a noninformative prior on the symbol probabilities of each class. Two versions of the model are developed under different a priori mislabeling assumptions for the data. In the first case, the probability of mislabeling is fixed and known, and in the second, the mislabeling is marginalized out, given it is a priori uniformly distributed from zero to one-half. A formula for the average probability of error is used to illustrate results that are plotted as a function of the quantization complexity, and for varying numbers of adapted mislabeled data. In general, it is shown that even for severe mislabeling, performance improves as more data are adapted to the training set.

Title: A statistical approach for textile fault detection

Abstract: The problem of textile quality control is addressed. The basic objective is to detect faults in woven fabrics. A set of statistical modules is implemented and integrated to detect the faulty textiles. The modules are divided into preprocessing modules (normalization, and median filtering) and processing modules (smoothing, and variance). The algorithms are experimented with a set of images of fault free and faulty textiles and output results are analyzed.

Title: Neural versus difference equation modeling for 2D pattern recognition problems

Abstract: The article study compares neural network based models and difference equation based models in 2D pattern recognition of handwritten digits. Pattern classifier models based on two neural network models were implemented using multi-layer feed forward neural networks: single layer perceptron and a multi-layer perceptron with one hidden layer. These two neural network models have nonlinear sigmoidal threshold units. A classifier model based on difference equations with linear weighted sum of all inputs was also implemented. Beside linear inputs, nonlinearities were introduced in all of the models by including products of inputs as new inputs. All models were trained/adjusted and tested using a handwritten digit database composed of a training set of 2360 digits and a testing set of 1320 digits. Each handwritten digit is composed of 15/spl times/23 binary pixels and each pixel is considered as a single input to the classifier. Classifier performance was measured as the correct classification rate on the testing database. Results show that the difference equation model with only linear inputs yielded the worse results (72.4%). Nevertheless, as products among inputs were included as new inputs, the classification performance increased (84.1%), thus exceeding the results of the single-layer perceptron with linear inputs (72.7%). The single-layer perceptron with nonlinear inputs gave an improvement of the classification result to 86.3%. The products among inputs can be interpreted as convolutional filtering over the input image to detect lines in different directions producing an overall improvement in the classification performance of all models.

Title: A comparison of neural and statistical techniques in object recognition

Abstract: The paper reports on an experimental comparison of two visual object recognition methods: a radial basis function network (RBFN) which is an artificial neural network, and a synthetic discriminant function network (SDFN) which classifies objects statistically via analysis with optimal spatial filters. Both methods require training with a set of images representative of the objects to be recognized. A comparative performance analysis was performed after training both networks with the same image sets. The algorithms were implemented on a Pentium-class PC under MS Windows NT 4.0. Training images were captured from a color CCD camera with standard NTSC resolution. Experiments were performed on both methods to determine the number of images per object necessary to train the networks, to estimate the two networks' accuracy of recognition, and to characterize their tolerance to image noise. It was found that when presented with a new image of one of the objects, RBFNs are more accurate at recognition than SDFNs. However, SDFNs are slightly more accurate in the presence of additive noise. Under the conditions of the experiments, RBFNs were found to provide an overall minimum classification accuracy of close to ninety percent.

Abstract: A novel statistical pattern recognition model is proposed in order to solve specific industrial diagnosis problems. The representation of discriminative parameters as a function of the operating point parameters enables accurate operating mode distance rejection. Adapted distance rejection options are presented in order to deal with unknown classes. These methods have been applied to a real world diagnosis problem: the monitoring of car catalytic converters.

Title: Trinocular data registration using a three-dimensional self-organizing feature map

Abstract: A three-dimensional self-organizing feature map (SOFM) that associates redundant and complementary features extracted from images acquired by a trinocular camera system is described. The combined features extracted from three views of the reference parts are used to train the SOFM. The unsupervised learning algorithm ensures that "similar" feature vectors will be assigned to cluster units that lie in close spatial proximity in the 3D feature map. The technique reduces the dimensionality of the input by exploiting hidden redundancies in the training data. During the identification phase, features in the novel test part activate a number of cluster units that have weights similar to the applied training input. If the sum-of-square error (SSE) between the input and weights of the cluster unit with the strongest response is greater than a predefined tolerance, then the test object is labeled as faulty part.

Title: Modular pattern classifiers: a brief survey

Abstract: While solving a complex pattern classification problem, it is often difficult to design a monolithic classifier. One approach is to divide the problem into smaller ones, and solve each subproblem using a simpler classifier. This kind of divide and conquer policy has motivated the researchers to substitute a modular classifier for the single monolithic classifier. The paper reviews the advantages, issues and various techniques available for designing the modular classifiers.

Title: A bat-like sonar system consisting of hardware digital correlators

Abstract: A prototype bat-like sonar system has been developed by implementing some of the bat techniques for interpreting sonar signals and mimicking their sensor configuration. The optimum method for estimating time-of-flight from the frequency-modulated echoes is correlation detection. In the field of photon correlation spectroscopy, a hardware digital correlator is employed to process the correlation function in real time. The paper presents an application of hardware digital correlators, implemented on a programmable logic device, as sonar signal processing systems for obstacle localization.

Title: A novel approach to analyze the result of polygraph

Abstract: The polygraph (lie detector) has been used for criminal verification in many countries for a long time. However, up to now its effectiveness has depended on the expertise of the tester. In addition, the training of a good tester will cost a lot of time. In order to make the polygraph more objective and easy to operate, we propose a novel automatic polygraph. Based on skin conductance response (SCR), pulse rate (PR) and respiration volume (RV) signals, random signal processing and pattern recognition methods were used to select tens of features. An identifier was designed to identify whether the answer is true or not. The experiments showed that the method is very effective.

Title: Evaluation of wavelet filters for speech recognition

Abstract: Since wavelet decomposition of signals provides more flexible time-frequency resolutions, it can be utilized as a feature set for speech recognition. The authors explore the possibility of using wavelet decomposition for speech recognition. In particular, they investigate a modified octave structured 5-level filter bank and the HMM (hidden Markov model) is used as a recognizer. We present an analysis of various wavelet filters for speech recognition and compare the results with the conventional features that include LPC and mel-cepstrums.

Title: Self-growing learning vector quantization with additional learning and rule extraction abilities

Abstract: We propose a self-growing learning vector quantization (SGLVQ). The proposed SGLVQ is constructed based on the self-organizing map (SOM) and the learning vector quantization (LVQ). Learning of the SGLVQ consists of 3 steps: SOM step, LVQ step, and rule extraction step. In the LVQ step, neurons are incremented and the size of the network is adjusted automatically. The incrementation of neurons enables additional learning and contributes to obtain high recognition ability. In the rule extraction step, rules can be extracted. Computer experiments show the improvement of the recognition rate, the ability of additional learning and extraction of the rules.

Title: Stability analysis of voting schemes on a continuous model

Abstract: We have extended and reinforced the previous discrete-model-based stability analysis of the national and regional voting by a continuous model where we have allowed the presence of the so-called white noise, and the concentrated noise. The result reconfirms the previous conclusion developed for image processing application that as long as the divided regions are not too small, the regional voting with smaller sized regions demonstrates always an improved robustness than those with larger sized regions.

Title: Reconstructing point patterns from incomplete nonmetric representations

Abstract: A method is developed for reconstructing point patterns using incomplete nonmetric information. This information consists of a rank-order list of interpoint distances for a P-point pattern. Nonmetric, in this context, means that a distance is not designated by its length in units, but simply by its rank in the list, the largest designated as having a rank of one. The list is incomplete because less than the full complement of P(P-1)/2 distances is included. The method builds on an algorithm developed for metric representations, and this algorithm is briefly discussed. Results are presented indicating that while the amount of information required increases as the number of points increases. The percentage of the distances that have to be ranked decreases.

Title: Correction of Renyi's 'gain of information'

Abstract: A number of measures have been proposed for the divergence (discrepancy, "distance") between two probability distributions. The first such generalized (parameterized) measure of divergence, or 'gain of information', was proposed by Renyi (1961, 1970). However, Renyi's measure is quite restrictive in terms of certain conditions that need to be met. The purpose of this paper is to suggest some corrections, or modifications, to Renyi's measure to make it less restrictive and potentially more useful.

Title: Induction of decision trees from partially classified data using belief functions

Abstract: A new tree-structured classifier based on the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence is presented. The entropy measure classically used to assess the impurity of nodes in decision trees is replaced by an evidence-theoretic uncertainty measure taking into account not only the class proportions, but also the number of objects in each node. The resulting algorithm allows the processing of training data whose class membership is only partially specified in the form of a belief function. Experimental results with EEG data are presented.

Title: Ambiguous problem investigation in off-line mathematical expression understanding

Abstract: As the Internet has been widely applied and digital libraries have been developed, the recognition and understanding of mathematical expressions that are included in scientific papers have become a significant research area. Because understanding mathematical expression ambiguity is connected with a person's sense and experience, we introduce mathematical rules, and a sense-based and experience-based dictionary into the rule base for our off-line mathematical expression understanding system. In order to set up these rules, we have to investigate ambiguity existing in mathematical textbooks and formulae collections. We investigate mathematics textbooks in Japanese high schools and formula collections, and enumerate many examples of ambiguous problems existing in mathematical expressions. Based on these samples, we discuss the trend of expressions with ambiguity, and summarize the classification of ambiguous problems. At the same time, we also obtain quantities of information about expressions, constants and variables in different subjects of mathematics.

Title: Robust speech/non-speech detection in adverse conditions using the fuzzy polarity correlation method

Abstract: Speech/non-speech detection is important in many areas of speech processing technology. In real environments, the speech signal is usually corrupted by background noise, which greatly affects the performance of speech processing systems. It is well known that a major cause of the efficiency decrease in automatic speech recognition (ASR) is the inaccurate detection of the endpoints. Therefore, high performance speech recognition requires efficient speech detection, especially in noisy environments. The paper describes a robust speech/non-speech detection algorithm with high reliability in very noisy environments. The algorithm is based on the fuzzy polarity correlation method. In order to decide on the speech/non-speech section, we use a similar degree between the positive polarity correlation sequence and the negative polarity correlation sequence for the input speech signal. The evaluation results show that this detection algorithm can obtain higher rates of accuracy in noisy environments.

Title: A proposal of fuzzy test for statistical hypothesis

Abstract: Taking up the typical test problem of statistical hypotheses, the paper studies fuzzy statistical hypotheses, their test method and its significance. Concretely, the null hypothesis H/sub 0/ that the population mean /spl mu/ is roughly /spl mu//sub 0/(/spl mu/=/spl mu/~/sub 0/) is tested by use of sample data x/sub i/(i=1,...,n) which is independently obtained from normal population, under the alternative one H/sub 1/ that is not roughly /spl mu//sub 0/(/spl mu//spl ne//spl mu/~/sub 0/). Their fuzzy hypotheses bring the possible rejection region and the necessary one corresponding to the conventional method. New aspects of this study are as follows: (1) this method arrives at a soft decision by referring to the grade of the possibility or the necessity that the sample value experimentally obtained belong to the above possible rejection region or the necessary one. On the other hand, the conventional one gives the strict and mechanical decision whether the hypothesis is acceptable or not. (2) The conventional method has the defect that the power of the test heavily decreases at /spl mu/=/spl mu//sub 1/ close to /spl mu//sub 0/ The proposed one can improve the defect thanks to the fuzzy hypotheses.

Title: Use of wavelets for ground-penetrating radar signal analysis and multisensor fusion in the frame of land mine detection

Abstract: In the frame of humanitarian land mine detection, a feature extraction method from ground penetrating radar (GPR) signals is presented. Based on the use of wavelets, this method should allow one to obtain a weighted decision for the GPR sensor and improvements in detection and false alarm rejection. A multisensor fusion principle with the weighted decision from the metal detector sensor is then presented.

Title: A similarity retrieval of 3D polygonal models using rotation invariant shape descriptors

Abstract: In virtual reality and multimedia applications, 3D polygonal models are increasing in number. Similarity retrieval is an important task in 3D polygonal model databases. We present rotation invariant shape descriptors for similarity retrieval. Our feature descriptor grouping technique overcomes the efficiency problem of query processing in high-dimensional shape descriptor spaces. Although high-dimensional feature descriptors are reduced by our techniques, they maintain high recall and precision.

Title: XML-based retrieval of object-oriented frameworks

Abstract: The productivity of software development largely depends on the degree of how much the ready-made software components are reused effectively. An object-oriented application framework is a semi-completed application. It enables software developers to reuse the knowledge from the application analysis and design phase as well as the development phase of software. As object-oriented frameworks are complex and large, the effectiveness of conventional approaches to retrieve reusable frameworks may be reduced. This paper proposes to model object-oriented frameworks using XML (Extensible Markup Language) and apply a retrieval technique for structured documents. It characterizes elements for describing framework information and suggests their schema. It also increases the effectiveness of search by expanding similar terms through query reformulation.

Title: EEG analysis using fast wavelet transform

Abstract: The continuous wavelet transform is a new approach to the problem of time-frequency analysis of signals such as EEG and is a promising method for EEG analysis. However, it requires a convolution integral in the time domain, so the amount of computation is enormous. In this study, we propose a fast wavelet transform which is comprised of the corrected basic fast algorithm and the fast wavelet transform for high accuracy to realize high computation speed and at the same time to improve computation accuracy. The corrected basic fast algorithm is based on using mother wavelets whose frequencies are lower by 2 octaves than the Nyquist frequency in the basic fast algorithm. The fast wavelet transform for high accuracy is realized by using upsampling which uses L-Spline interpolation. The experiments demonstrate advantages of our approach and show its effectiveness for EEG analysis.

Title: A study on reconfigurable computing system for cryptography

Abstract: This paper introduces a reconfigurable computing technique for encryption processing. Reconfigurable computing (RC) is capable of accelerating the information processing using dynamic reconfiguration of field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). Dividing the target problems into hardware and software processing appropriately, the computation time will become much faster. A fast and flexible encryption technique is required on the Internet. An encryption technique generally consumes computational power and needs specific hardware for feasible use. Specific hardware is not capable of changing its architecture to adapt to new functionality. RC is suitable for this purpose. We implemented an RC system on an FPGA board. To examine the feasibility of this system, we apply it to encryption processing.

Title: Spatial information sharing with patch-working of feature drawings

Abstract: While many people use digital maps in their car navigation systems or on the Web, many potential users are still overwhelmed by spatial information sharing. They are nervous about maintaining maps, which need to be kept up to date. We discuss the problem of maintaining geodata and describe the basic concept of MW (Marche World) and one of its groupware applications. Its ideas of spatial information headers and a floating coordinate system conform to the access control architecture for charging for spatial contents and enable the innovative utilization of geodata. Charging contents could not only reduce the initial installation cost, but could also continuously charge various users an appropriate price. We developed a prototype system for a police traffic department. Its multi-resolution data of drawings, photos and maps is shared and kept alive among a variety of organizations by the virtual workflow of the maintenance.

Title: Autonomous robotic positioning umbilical system

Abstract: The work presented in this paper describes the development of an autonomous umbilical positioning system. A NASA unmanned mission will place a propellant manufacturing and nuclear facility on the surface of Mars. In the subsequent mission, a space vehicle will land within 1 km of this facility for safety reasons. A wheeled mobile robot will be used to make the umbilical connection to the nuclear facility. The mate-in umbilical plate is mounted on a Cartesian manipulator, which is installed on the mobile robot base. The mobile robot is controlled in a teleoperated mode. The operator will use vision feedback to guide the mobile base to get close to the mate-to plate. When in the local positioning zone, the control is switched to autonomous mode. The information received from ultrasonic sensors is used to identify the position of the mate-to plate and mate the umbilical plates. A successful experimentation verifies the approach.

Title: Using Petri nets for data dependency analysis

Abstract: Due to design constraints, many digital systems are implemented as mixed hardware and software components. An informal choice of implementing a part of the system, either in software or in hardware, can produce incorrect or unsatisfactory results. Co-design methodologies have been developed to aid the development of such systems. The partitioning phase is one of the tasks carried out by a co-design methodology. It divides the original system into components taking in account software or hardware implementation. This work presents a model to carry out data dependency analysis, which is one of the aspects considered for the partitioning algorithm of the PISH codesign methodology.

Title: A study on the fuzzy control navigation and the obstacle avoidance of mobile robot using camera

Abstract: This paper describes a vision-based path planning method in an indoor environment for an autonomous mobile robot that can avoid obstacles that might appear in the path of a navigating robot. A fuzzy logic controller is used to control the position of a mobile robot. We use the wavelet transform to detect the edges of guidelines and obstacles. We suggest an algorithm that can be used in the control of the mobile robot without collisions with obstacles. The distance between the robot and the obstacle as well as the size of the obstacle can be measured using a single camera and several ultrasonic sensors. We suggest an algorithm of path planning with these methods.

Title: Lane and obstacle detection based on fast inverse perspective mapping algorithm

Abstract: A fast inverse perspective mapping algorithm (FIPMA) is presented for a fast and accurate recovery of road surface from a given 2D road image. FIPMA is able to simplify the system design without losing reliability and flexibility. A novel lane and obstacle detection method, using only a single CCD camera, is proposed based on a recovered road surface image by FIPMA. This method includes five parts: recovering the road surface from the input road image using FIPMA; processing the recovered surface image; detecting lane and estimating lane parameters; updating camera parameters adaptively; and detecting obstacles.

Title: A Petri-net-based model for the mathematical analysis of multi-agent systems

Abstract: Agent technology is widely recognized as a new paradigm for the design of concurrent software and systems. The aim of this paper is to give a mathematical foundation for the design and the analysis of multi-agent systems by means of a Petri-net-based model. The proposed model is based on place/transition nets, one of the simplest classes of Petri nets. The main difference is that each token, representing an agent, is also a place/transition net. It is sufficiently simple for the mathematical analysis, but has enough modeling power.

Title: Minimum initial marking in timed marked graphs

Abstract: This paper addresses the minimum initial marking (MIM) in timed marked graphs. In this problem both the net and the cycle time are fixed, so the problem consists in finding out a minimum initial marking M/sub 0/ such that the cycle time of the TMG will be less or equal to the required one. The main result of this work is the heuristic algorithm MIM Solver to solve the MIM problem. It computes a subset of p-semiflows and adds tokens to places in two steps. First it adds the minimum number of tokens needed to reduce the difference between the required cycle time /spl pi//sup d/ and the cycle time /spl pi//sub i/ of each p-semiflow belonging to the computed subset. The difference /spl pi//sup d/-/spl pi//sub i/>0 must be minimum. In this step a heuristic based on the places belonging to the maximum number of p-semiflows is used. Afterwards, the algorithm adds the largest number of tokens in p-semiflows to fulfil cycle time constraints. In this step a heuristic based on the places belonging to the shortest number of p-semiflows is used.

Title: Hierarchical analysis of manufacturing systems using Petri nets

Abstract: Hierarchical analysis of manufacturing systems is performed in a top-down manner in which a general, approximate model is used to capture the main effects of component interconnections, while more detailed models of components provide the detailed information needed for the derivation of performance characteristics of the entire system. For Petri net models, this approach corresponds to stepwise refinements of models. Structural analysis, based on place invariants combined with simple net transformations, is used to obtain performance characteristics of the modeled systems.

Title: Markovian analysis of a heterogeneous system: application to a cooperation task for multiple consumer robots

Abstract: This paper shows how a probabilistic model is able to predict the evolution of most multi-robot systems and thus to save a lot of simulation time. To demonstrate the performance of this approach, a complex heterogeneous system is considered. It is composed of two populations of robots, having different but complementary abilities. They must survive by finding supply centers in the environment. It is shown how to model the process by a stochastic Petri net and its associated Markov chain. The latter allows one to compute the time evolution of the system. The process includes several sink states, which correspond to a singular problem. However, comparisons of simulation and theoretical results show very close values of the state probabilities when the agents are initially located at random positions. The number of agents is varied in order to obtain the most favorable terminal state: the Markovian analysis is shown to help one to determine the best parameters. Finally, the hardware used in experiments is described.

Title: Reconfigurable fault tolerant deadlock avoidance controller synthesis for assembly production processes

Abstract: Guarantee of deadlock-free operations is a prerequisite for achieving high resource utilization in flexible manufacturing systems. As production processes may contend for shared resources, the addition or removal of production processes has impacts on the liveness property of the systems. Uncertainties in manufacturing systems may result in unavailability of resources and may in turn lead to deadlocks and have negative impacts on the scheduled activities and performance. The design of deadlock avoidance control logics for manufacturing systems with unreliable machines to meet changeable, high-variety of product demands is a challenging problem. We develop deadlock avoidance control synthesis algorithms that are: (1) reconfigurable to incorporate or remove production processes while maintaining the liveness property, (2) robust to cope with uncertainties, and (3) scalable for realistic cases.

Title: An approach to Korean license plate recognition based on vertical edge matching

Abstract: License plate recognition (LPR) has many applications in traffic monitoring systems. In this paper, a vertical edge matching based algorithm to recognize a Korean license plate from an input gray-scale image is proposed. The algorithm is able to recognize license plates in normal shape, as well as plates that are out of shape due to the angle of view. The proposed algorithm is fast enough and the recognition unit of the LPR system can be implemented only in software so that the cost of the system is reduced.

Title: The state equation of Petri net for the LD program

Abstract: This paper presents the process for converting A and B contacts in the ladder diagram (LD) into a Petri net (PN). In order to represent the A and B contacts in the LD program with the PN graph, the concept of preservation arc is introduced. The resulting PN is then compared with the conventional PN using a timing chart. The state equation for the A and B contacts is constructed in a transition vector. Using the equation, each state equation for the LD program is created, such as the A contact function and the B contact function. The state equations are validated using examples.

Title: Time Petri nets for workflow modelling and analysis

Abstract: Time management in workflow processes is crucial in determining and controlling the life cycle of business activities. In our model, a temporal interval as an execution duration is assigned to every workflow task. While the real time taken by the task is nondeterministic and unpredictable, it may be between the bounds thus specified. We extend workflow nets (WF-nets) with time intervals and call the new nets Time WF-nets (TWF-nets). Extending our previous results on timed Petri nets, we show that certain behavioural properties of workflow processes modelled in TWF-nets can be verified. Using a clinical health care process as a case study, we also illustrate the modelling of shared resources available at different times.

Title: A modular modeling approach for automated manufacturing systems based on shared resources and process planning using Petri nets

Abstract: The modeling of automated manufacturing systems has been studied to cope with production planning and control problems. Petri nets have been applied to model these systems because they provide resources to represent the system behavior. When the systems are too large or complex, the modeling task is difficult and the elements in the model are too many for a simple understanding and analysis. This paper proposes an approach to modeling these systems to minimize these difficulties. The proposed approach uses Petri nets and a modular strategy considering shared resources and alternative process planning. Using this approach, a system has been modeled. First the system elements for the modeling job were considered, and then the modules were linked to build the complete model.

Title: Benchmarking an algorithm for Petri net scheduling

Abstract: This paper evaluates a Petri net algorithm for scheduling production systems. The examples presented are taken from the literature and could describe flexible manufacturing systems as well as multi-purpose batch plants. Production systems include a large variety of constraints that make the scheduling task difficult. The main reason for choosing Petri nets is the powerful modeling capacity. Different problem types are examined and the disadvantages and advantages with of a Petri net algorithm are discussed.

Title: Timed Petri net models of cluster tools

Abstract: Timed Petri nets are used as models of cluster tools, representing not only the concurrent activities of different chambers, but also the durations of these activities. Structural analysis, based on net invariants, provides basic performance measures, such as throughput and cycle time. The results are obtained in symbolic form, so many specific alternatives can easily be compared without repeated analyses of the models.

Title: Dynamic reconfiguration of software objects using Petri nets and network unfolding

Abstract: This paper demonstrates the use of supervisory control theory in synthesizing plug-ins for distributed software. The plug-ins are software objects that supervise an existing distributed system so that certain properties such as fairness and deadlock freedom are guaranteed. The distributed application is modeled as a bounded ordinary Petri net and system analysis is accomplished through a partial order method known as unfolding. The unfolding constructs an event structure that provides a natural encapsulation of concurrent threads of execution whose selective disablement by the supervisory plug-in assures the desired application property. The synthesis of the plug-in is based on results from supervisory control theory and the synthesized plug-ins are optimal in that they are maximally permissive. We demonstrate our approach on a distributed cache system.

Title: A Petri net based approach for establishing necessary software design and testing requirements

Abstract: In this paper, a Petri net based approach for establishing the minimal design and testing requirements for software systems is presented. It is based on a technique called the minimal transition cover set (MTCS), developed from minimal transition invariants of the corresponding Petri net model (Ramaswamy and Barber, 1997). The MTCS is based on identifying the important decisions being made within the design model. Depending on the design requirements, a designer may choose to expand lower level procedures during an analysis, and thereby, generate information about other lower-level decisions selectively within the design which are to be made available to other sub-systems. A further modification of the MTCS approach is used to derive the decision nodes that are buried within the design model. Again, a software test engineer may either choose to selectively build test cases for individual modules and incorporate them as stubs in a higher level module, or integrate these modules within higher level modules before deriving appropriate test case scenarios. Building test cases based on the deep decision nodes gives the necessary test cases for system verification. The equivalence and the easier applicability of MTCS based test case generation method with McCabe's cyclomatic complexity measure is also briefly addressed.

Title: A Petri net-based formal reasoning algorithm for fuzzy production rule-based systems

Abstract: Efficient reasoning for a complex fuzzy production rule-based system is a very important research issue and has many applications in unstructured environments with incomplete/imprecise information only. This paper presents a fuzzy reasoning Petri net (FRPN) model to represent a fuzzy production rule-based system. Based on the model, a formal reasoning algorithm using the operators in max-algebra is proposed to perform fuzzy reasoning automatically. The algorithm is consistent with the matrix equation expression method in the traditional Petri nets and allows one to exploit maximum parallel reasoning potential embedded in the model. Its legitimacy and feasibility are proved and validated through an example.

Title: New structured and hierarchical network model for designing FA control system

Abstract: This paper proposes a new method for FA system software development. As computer technology continues to be upgraded yearly to higher levels, factory automation systems are becoming larger and more complex. The system architecture has changed from centralized processing to distributed processing to reduce the development cost and improve reliability. When we develop distributed processing systems, sometimes we encounter difficulties; for instance, inadequate expression methods, and not yet established analyzing techniques for the control mechanism. These difficulties are derived from non-deterministic characteristics of FA systems, and there are a large number of combinations of control conditions based on the characteristics. Our research proposes a new development method for FA system software to solve the above problems. The main idea behind our method is to delineate the total control logic in a structured and hierarchical network model. We have also developed a software engineering system based on the proposed method.

Title: Modeling train control systems with Petri nets-a functional reference-architecture

Abstract: Control systems for guided traffic primarily have the task to ensure safe but efficient operation. This paper shows an approach to model such systems in two general steps: the analysis of existing systems to define the functional units and the construction of the train control system. To reach the goal of the train control system specific functions are used which can be classified in functions for protection, supervision of operation and optimization. These functions are modeled as abstract functional blocks, independent from the implementation of a specific train control system. By means of these building blocks existing or new train control systems can be modeled, simulated and analyzed. The method presented is a part of the framework BASYSNET which is founded on Petri nets as means of description.

Title: Holistic modeling of complex systems with Petri nets

Abstract: This paper discusses an approach to integrate the modern techniques of software development such as SA/SD and OOA/OOD into the modeling process of complex systems with Petri nets, taking advantage of the strengths of these methods and meanwhile dealing with some of their limitations. The modeling procedure is introduced and discussed in detail. At first the overall system structure is modeled by means of a Component Structure Diagram (CSD) which is a Petri net model. Then the modeling of system components is emphasized either on their functional or data (object) aspects corresponding to their properties. The models of different views (dynamics, functions and data) of a component are integrated on the basis of Petri nets. The scopes and borders of different views' models are clearly defined. The overall system model is set up through a smooth integration of the models of individual views of system components as well as the integration of component models with the system structure model.

Title: Development of real-time system specifications through the refinement of duration interval Petri nets

Abstract: This paper aims at the development of an engineering technique for the construction of systems through the refinement of duration interval transitions. The theoretical system model is based on so-called interval time Petri nets. Duration interval transitions turn out to be a syntactical abbreviation for a certain structure of interval time Petri nets. The kind of refinement technique preserves the safety property and guarantees that the refined system behaves neither slower nor faster than the unrefined one. The application of our approach lies in the development of time correct system specifications.

Title: Scheduling batch systems using a Petri net model and an intelligent backtrack mechanism

Abstract: The objective of this paper is to study the scheduling problem of batch systems with a cyclic feeding policy. The proposed approach is based on the formal representation of the system constraints by using a p-time t-timed Petri net model. A token player algorithm with an intelligent backtrack mechanism is then used to compute a feasible schedule consistent with the set of constraints.

Title: Extending G-nets to support inheritance modeling in concurrent object-oriented design

Abstract: G-nets are a type of Petri net defined to support the modeling of a system as a set of independent and loosely-coupled modules. The modular features of G-nets provide support for incremental design and successive modification, however the G-net formalism is not fully object-oriented due to a lack of support for inheritance. We introduce extensions to G-nets to support explicit modeling of inheritance. Bounded buffer examples are used, which we define as subclasses of an unbounded buffer, to illustrate the expressive power of the extended G-net models. Various forms of inheritance are formalized and discussed in the context of concurrent object-oriented design. In addition, the inheritance anomaly problem is examined and discussed.

Title: Analysis of Petri net models using transitive matrix

Abstract: We focus on the analysis of Petri net models using a subnet. We propose a divide and conquer method of Petri nets under the condition of one-boundedness for all the Petri nets. The usefulness of the approach is shown by applying the proposed techniques to an illustration model.

Title: Specification of distributed systems with actors using object-oriented Petri nets

Abstract: Two methodologies and technologies are integrated in this paper: distributed object-oriented programming and visual programming with object-oriented Petri nets (OOPNs). Distributed object-oriented systems are represented by means of active objects, called actors. A formal specification of actors is achieved by means of OOPNs, which are based on colored Petri nets enriched by the object-oriented paradigm. We combine these methods into a single methodology for the formal specification of distributed systems with actors by means of OOPNs. OOPNs are based on viewing objects as active servers that offer re-entrant services to other objects. A class consists of an object net, describing the internal activity, and several method nets, describing the services the class provides to other classes.

Title: A framework of features selection for the case-based reasoning

Abstract: CBR is a problem solving technique that reuses past cases and experiences to find a solution to problems. A critical issue in case based reasoning is to select the correct and enough features to represent a case. For this reason, the analysis of cases and extraction of the necessary features to represent a case are highly recommended in building a CBR system. However, this task is difficult to carry out since such knowledge often cannot be successfully and exhaustively captured and represented. A framework of feature mining system for the case based reasoning including two phases is proposed. The techniques of feature selection, data analysis and machine learning can thus be effectively integrated. This will promote flexibility and expandability of the case based reasoning system.

Title: Learning sensory motor coordination for grasping by a humanoid robot

Abstract: The paper proposes a method for the learning of Sensory-Motor Coordination (SMC) through the teleoperation of a humanoid robot designed for human-robot interaction. It is argued that SMC in a complex environment must be learned rather than programmed. Schema theory is reviewed as a tool for the description of animal behavior at the level of functional modules and higher. SMC is shown to be necessary for the formation of schema assemblages for the control of behavior. Examples are given of four behavior based robot control architectures that implicitly use SMC-driven schema control. It is shown that while the robots are capable of learning, they all rely, to a certain extent, on ad hoc choices of SMC by the designers. A description of the humanoid robot and the sensors it uses for reaching and grasping is given. The proposed method of learning via teleoperation is described. Sensory data acquired through grasping is presented.

Title: Incorporating communication monitoring and control facility in multi-agent systems

Abstract: In multiple agent computing environments, the communication issue for negotiation, task allocation, etc. is vital for agents to do their tasks. It has been shown that agent systems with many intercommunicating agents can be very difficult to develop without appropriate tools to monitor and mediate communications. Moreover, without agent communication management, the performance of agent systems with large participants may suffer from communication livelocks, deadlock and inconsistency. The objective of this paper is to explore how to improve the multiagent system development process by incorporating a high-level monitoring and control facility into agent communication and distribution environments. A Petri net-based modeling approach is adopted in constructing task-oriented conversation schemata. Conversation managers are deployed into agent daemons throughout the network to provide an environment at network nodes to which agents may be dispatched. An example in an agent-based shop floor is briefly introduced.

Title: Identification of an output error Takagi-Sugeno model

Abstract: The identification of a TS model with output error local models is considered. The premise part of the TS model is assumed to be described by a lattice partition. The main problem involved is the determination of the premise variables, the associated number of modalities and the structure of the local models. The premise optimisation is solved by a forward approach and the structure of the local models are further refined using a pruning technique. The application of the overall procedure on a simulation example is reported.

Title: Adaptive learning control for nonminimum phase systems

Abstract: A novel adaptive learning algorithm is presented for the repetitive tracking control of a class of unstable nonminimum phase systems. After each repetitive trial, a least squares method is used to estimate the system parameters. The output tracking error and the identified system model are used through stable inversion to find the feed forward input, together with the desired state trajectories for the next trial. An adaptive backstepping based tracking controller is used in each trial to ensure the regulation of the desired state trajectories. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed learning control scheme is very effective in reproducing the desired trajectories.

Title: A novel learning method for intelligent agents

Abstract: The objective of the study is to synthesize a learning model capable of successful and effective operation in hard-to-model environments. The authors present a structurally simple and functionally flexible model. The model follows the learning patterns experienced by the humans. The novelty of the adaptive model lies in the knowledge base, dual learning strategy, and flexible reasoning. The knowledge base is allowed to grow for as long as the agent lives. Learning is brought about by the interaction between two qualitatively different activities leaving long-term and short-term marks on the behavior of the agent. The agent reaches conclusions using approximate reasoning. The focus of the model, the agent, starts life with a blank knowledge base. It learns as it lives. Classifiers are used to represent individual experiences. We demonstrate the functioning of the model through a case study.

Title: Adaptive learning interface used physiological signals

Abstract: The purpose of the article is the development of an interface which closely adapts to the individual. By quantifying the frustration as the human manipulates machines from a biomedical signal and making it into teaching signals of machine learning (ML), we aim at the development of a system in which the machine adapts to the human. The authors extract the characteristic vector of whether the examinee is in discomfort or not from electroencephalograms (EEG) and electromyograms (EMG). An artificial neural network (ANN) is employed to extract the vector. For the machine learning, reinforcement learning is used and the rewards are an extracted signal from physiological signals. As a basic experiment for extracting discomfort and comfort from the physiological signals, the EEG measurement experiment was carried out under an unpleasant sound environment for 20 examinees. The input signals to ANN for the characteristic vector extraction was examined. By affixing piezoelectric films on the eyebrow, the movement of the eyebrow was measured. Finally, the results of measuring EEG and EMG simultaneously under the situation in which frustration accumulated for the examinee are shown. We use reinforcement learning (RL) to control the behavior of the Khepera robot.

Title: A step towards the Smart Campus: a venture project based on distance learning by a hybrid video conferencing system

Abstract: We have evaluated the effectiveness of project based distance learning (PBDL) as a means of expanding the number of business persons who take post-graduate courses, particularly in entrepreneurial studies. We established that for learning based on entrepreneurial projects, the two-way distribution of text and still images via the IP network, and of audio-visual transmissions at 64 kbps speeds via low-cost ISDN or ADSL lines, are practical for communications between users. Again, the audio-visual information made a major contribution to the mutual trust between business persons and university people, who had had little or no previous contact with each other, which is necessary in carrying out such an entrepreneurial project. In entrepreneurial project based real time distance learning, the hybrid video conference system proved effective as a low cost network environment for the stable distribution of audio-visual information and documents. On the other hand, for non-real time distance learning, there is an urgent need to develop an expert exchange system that will make it possible to exchange information with experts possessing advanced entrepreneurial information and to access a database formed from this advanced information.

Title: A metadata based distance learning platform

Abstract: Distance learning is acquiring a role that becomes more and more important with the huge diffusion of the Internet and related technologies. Consequently, the investigation for adequate architectures and platforms supporting flexible distance learning engines and solution is nowadays of great interest in the scientific community. The paper introduces a platform based on the adoption of metadata concepts and on the use of a "processor-like" behavior of the Web Course Delivery engine that appears to be a good solution when different and heterogeneous modules have to be integrated in the platform. The proposed system is currently under development and test in the framework of a European Esprit Project.

Title: Intelligent planning of trajectories for pick-and-place operations

Abstract: Intelligent industrial robots, unlike their current re-programmable counterparts, should be able to work in a time varying environment and must have the capability to respond to unanticipated situations. The work presented is concentrated on the trajectory planning phase of an online prediction planning execution strategy for such situations. A neural network based solution for the generation of time based control set points is proposed. This solution uses a feedback neural network, which can be trained using the extensively used backpropagation algorithm. The proposed neural based trajectory generator ensures a real time solution consistent with electric actuator safety requirements. The generator is evaluated for pick-and-place operations of a RRR manipulator.

Title: Artificial immune systems: application to autonomous agents

Abstract: The function of the immune system is to protect the living body against invaders through the use of defensive mechanisms. Some previous researchers have used artificial immune systems (AIS) to solve diverse engineering problems. The purpose of the paper is to apply the AIS technique to a distributed autonomous robotics system (DARS) problem. One of the classic problems in DARS is the dog and sheep problem. The authors try to benefit from the features of the natural immune system in the development of the dog and sheep problem. On the other hand, we find that natural immune systems are sophisticated information processors. They learn to recognize relevant patterns; they remember patterns that have been seen previously; and, they use diversity to promote robustness. Furthermore, the individual cells and molecules that comprise the immune system are distributed throughout the body, encoding and controlling the system in parallel, with no central control mechanism. The immune system uses several weapons to attack the foreign antigen. Abstractly, these weapons are the helper T-cells, B-cells, and antibodies. We simulated the dog as a B cell, the sheep as an antigen, the antibody as the dog behavior, the antigen response as the sheep behavior, and the sheep-to-pen distance as a helper T cell. The system interacts in an equivalent manner to the immune response, trying to restore the environment to its original state, which is the sheep inside the pen.

Title: Fuzzy rule base optimisation: a pruning and merging approach

Abstract: The paper deals with the simplification of the rule base of the Takagi-Sugeno model. The proposed technique assumes an initial lattice partition of the premise space. The complexity of the rule base is optimised through two sequential operations: elimination of the less important rules followed by the merging of neighbouring rules that can describe the same behaviour of the system. The identified structure is further refined by adjusting the parameters of the membership functions. The procedure is illustrated on a simulation example.

Title: Design discovery for social recommendation of Web graphics

Abstract: To apply social recommendation to image databases, we have developed an clustering algorithm that takes account of both social and content based similarity between image items. Resulting clusters are called "design groups" since it represents visual features appealing to users. The system organizes image items and recommends designs that will appeal to the user. We have applied this technique to a Web graphics database and evaluated its effectiveness by user testing.

Title: Self-adaptive expert system for facial expression analysis

Abstract: The authors attempt to automate facial expression recognition and introduce it into man-machine interaction as a new modality. This will make the interaction compact and more efficient. As the first step, we developed a self-adaptive expert system that accepts the facial feature contours localized in a static dual-view facial image and returns the expression interpretation label(s) used by the user. Expression identification in terms of the encountered facial actions is also displayed to the user. Reasoning with uncertainty about the extracted facial expression data is employed for facial action coding and quantification. A memory of experiences, inspired by R.C. Schank's (1984) theory of human autobiographical memory organization and instance based learning, expounds the encoded facial actions in terms of the learned interpretation labels. Validation studies on the prototype suggest that the expression identification and interpretation achieved are generally consistent with those defined by the users.

Title: PERSES-a vision-based interactive mobile shopping assistant

Abstract: The paper describes the general idea, the application scenario, and selected methodological approaches of our long term research project PERSES (PERsonal SErvice System). The aim of the project consists of the development of an interactive mobile shopping assistant that allows a continuous and intuitively understandable interaction with a customer in a home improvement store. Typical tasks we have to tackle are to detect and contact potential users in the operation area, to guide them to desired areas or articles within the store or to follow them as a mobile information kiosk while continuously observing their behavior. Due to the specificity of the interaction-oriented scenario and the characteristics of the operation area, we have focused on vision based methods for both human-robot interaction and robot navigation. Besides some methodological approaches, we present preliminary results of experiments achieved with our mobile robot PERSES in the store with an emphasis on vision based methods for user localization, map building and self-localization.

Title: Implementing software connectors through first-class methods

Abstract: Recently, vast amounts of research efforts have been made to derive a higher-level abstraction mechanism than the class abstraction in object oriented languages. Notable examples include the research activities on software architectures and component based software development. Of these, software architectures allow us to focus on the issue of software connectors, which are used to describe interactions between software components in the context of architectural styles. However, few contemporary programming languages support the explicit notion of connectors, which makes it difficult to practice software development based on software architectural concepts. The authors present their experience in implementing software connectors through first-class methods in the Java programming language. They view software connectors as methods over methods and show that a suitable set of reflective facilities can be a nice device for implementing software connectors.

Title: Pitch estimator for noisy speech signals

Abstract: In this paper, a new noise-immune algorithm for the pitch estimation of speech signals is introduced. The main features of this algorithm are its accurate pitch value estimation in severe noisy environments and its capability of also being used as a speech enhancer. The algorithm is based on both the principles of using an adaptive digital filter (ADF) as a self-tuning filter, first introduced by J.R. Widrow et al. (1975), and the use of the ADF for speech enhancement, as introduced by M.R. Sambour (1978).

Title: Two models of immunization for time dependent optimization

Abstract: This paper investigates the relevance of the immune system metaphor to time-dependent optimization (TDO). First, we review previous results underlining the over-average reactiveness and robustness featured by Sais (Simple Artificial Immune System) in comparison to well-known evolutionist approaches. Then, we evaluate its immunization capability (i.e. improving its robustness to previously encountered optima) and eventually propose Yasais (Yet Another Simple Artificial Immune System).

Title: Hardware fault tolerance: an immunological solution

Abstract: Since the advent of computers, numerous approaches have been taken to create hardware systems that provide a high degree of reliability even in the presence of errors. This paper addresses the problem from a biological perspective using the human immune system as a source of inspiration. The immune system uses many ingenious methods to provide reliable operation in the body and so may suggest how similar methods can be used in the future design of reliable computer systems. The paper addresses this challenge through the implementation of an immunised finite state machine-based counter. The proposed methods demonstrate how through a process of self/non-self-differentiation, the hardware immune system creates a set of tolerance conditions to monitor the change in states of the hardware. Potential faults may then be flagged, assessed and the appropriate recovery action taken.

Title: An approach to visualization of active position in brain by MEG

Abstract: Reports a way to visualize the active position of the brain, and an improvement method to estimate the dipole of the MEG (magnetoencephalogram), which is the central part of the activation. In the past, at the Medical School of Osaka University, a method was used where an early-stage position was set manually and only its neighborhood was searched, but that method is less precise. On the other hand, our new method automatically estimates the dipole position and its moment for all positions of the brain. As a result, the measurement accuracy of the dipole position and moment was improved, and the position and moment derived from this calculation is medically adequate.

Title: A comparison of negative and positive selection algorithms in novel pattern detection

Abstract: This paper describes a technique based on immunological principles for novel (anomalous) pattern detection. It is a probabilistic method that uses a negative selection scheme (complement pattern space) to detect any changes in the normal behavior of monitored data patterns. The technique is compared with a positive selection approach (implemented by an ART neural network), which uses the (self-) pattern space for anomaly detection. Some experimental results in both cases are reported.

Title: iNet: an extensible framework for simulating immune network

Abstract: The natural immune system is a subject of great research interest because it provides powerful and flexible information processing capabilities as a complex adaptive system. This paper describes our extensible framework, named iNet, for building artificial immune systems, particularly artificial immune networks, which has been used in several of our projects developing biologically-inspired intelligent applications. We describe the iNet architecture, its design principles and features, highlighting its versatility and component reusability. We also describe an autonomous decentralized network application built with iNet as a sample use case for showing how to use it.

Title: Modeling virtual cities based on interaction between cells

Abstract: A novel method is described for automatically modeling virtual cities that change over time. Cellular automata are used to lay out the buildings, and a genetic algorithm is used to produce the time series of changes. The cellular automata are given one of several states: vacant, four kinds of buildings and two kinds of roads. The sequence of applied rules needed to generate the series of changes is determined using a genetic algorithm.

Title: A biological decision-theoretic intelligent agent solution to a herding problem in the context of distributed multi-agent systems

Abstract: Proposes a biological decision-theoretic intelligent agent model to solve a herding problem. The proposed intelligent agent model is designed by combining Bayesian networks and influence diagrams. In our agent design, we used Y. Shoham's (1993) agent-oriented programming paradigm that defines an intelligent agent by its belief, preference and capabilities. Intelligent agent software is written to realize the proposed intelligent agent model. The same software is then used to simulate the herding problem with one sheep and one dog. Simulation results show that the proposed intelligent agent is successful in establishing a goal (herding) and learning other agents' behaviors.

Title: Simulation of thrombin generation during plasmatic coagulation and primary hemostasis

Abstract: Describes a simulation of the platelet agglutination in a damaged vein. This agglutination, called plasmatic coagulation, appears in the human body and its malfunction involves dramatic diseases like thrombosis or hemophilia. We designed an in-machina experimentation that is very difficult to do in-vitro. The first aim of this simulation is to verify one of the biological models of plasmatic coagulation and primary hemostasis. The second aim is to test different ways to regulate the thrombin production. Then, we simulate a haemophilia-like disease and one of its possible treatments.

Title: Human-like behavior robot-application to disabled people assistance

Abstract: In the field of rehabilitation robotics, a mobile personal robot represents an attractive solution, even in economical terms, in comparison with a desktop workstation. The assistance system ARPH is composed of a manipulator arm mounted on a mobile robot. In order to avoid the increasing complexity due to the need of system autonomy in a partially known environment, our approach is based on a close man-machine cooperation. The disabled person and the system provide their skills and execute missions by a dynamic task-sharing. The first condition for a good cooperation is that the person understands how the robot works. It is made easier if robot autonomous functions have human-like behaviours. The paper presents this approach for the main functions required for the robot displacement: planning, navigation and to a minor extend localisation. Man-machine cooperation is evaluated by an experiment in which users control the mobile robot during a "go to the target" mission.

Title: Study of methods for model reduction in transition systems

Abstract: We consider the reinforcement learning problem where the agent interacts with the environment by taking actions. The agent receives some reward from the environment and changes state as a result. The problem is to find a good policy in large transition systems such that the agent's value function is maximized. If the transition system is Markovian, there exist several algorithms for finding the optimum policy in such systems. However, finding the optimum policy may take considerable time for large systems, and the learning algorithm will not converge if we allow a smaller number of iterations. Our objective is to investigate methods of reducing the state space of large transition systems, and to evaluate the effect of model reduction on getting a good policy in reasonable time. We conjecture that when we have limited time, it may be wise to reduce the transition system and then apply our learning algorithm to the smaller system.

Title: Decision mechanisms analysis for the stepping motion over an obstacle based on a biomechanical approach

Abstract: Presents a contribution to a better understanding of the human decision mechanisms involved in a stepping motion over an obstacle. Our aim is to determine the "optimal" strategies adapted to a human body model's evolution under external perturbation during the task execution (external force applied on the trunk in the sagittal plane). Firstly, we exploit physiological data by means of a 3D system for motion measurement and a force platform. The analysis of the experimental results allows us to identify and to quantify the relevant kinematic parameters during this special task. Secondly, we use the biomechanical model of a human structure called "BIPMAN" (BIPedal MAN) and a dynamic control scheme previously developed by P. Gorce (1994, 1995) to ensure dynamic stability during the stepping motion when perturbation occurs.

Title: A new application of the DIRECT model to the visual control of a robot

Abstract: In this paper a new application of the DIRECT neural algorithm on a robotic platform is presented. In (Guerrero et al., 1999) the first application of the DIRECT algorithm over a robotic platform was presented. The performance of this algorithm depends mainly on the neural maps which carry out the motor-spatial and spatial-motor transformations. In this paper, a new internal structure of the motor-spatial neural maps is proposed which allows reducing the required memory, enhancing the accuracy of the motor-spatial transformation, and reducing the learning times. The performance of this algorithm is analysed with several experiments on an experimental platform constituted by a robot arm and a stereohead.

Title: Reinforcement learning with continuous vector output

Abstract: A new reinforcement learning algorithm with continuous vector output (CVRL) is proposed for a continuous process with multiple-input and multiple-output. CVRL is a generic hierarchically structured framework. The lower layer is composed with several groups of action units and continuous vector output can be produced based on action combination. The higher layer is a Q-learning unit defined on the space of combined action, its responsibility is the selection of properly combined actions. A detailed implementation of the CVRL is given, and the simulation on a mobile robot navigation problem demonstrates its effectiveness.

Title: Improving clustering with hidden Markov models using Bayesian model selection

Abstract: This paper presents a Bayesian clustering methodology that partitions temporal data into homogeneous groups, and constructs state based profiles for each group in the hidden Markov model (HMM) framework. We propose a Bayesian HMM clustering methodology that improves upon existing HMM clustering algorithm by incorporating HMM model size selection into the clustering control structure. Experimental results indicate the effectiveness of our methodology.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is an efficient method for solving Markov decision processes (MDPs) without any priori knowledge about an environment. Q-learning is a representative RL. Though it is guaranteed to derive the optimal policy, Q-learning needs numerous trials to learn the optimal policy. By the use of the feature of Q value, this paper presents an accelerated RL method, the Q-ae learning. Further, utilizing the dynamic programming principle, this paper proves the convergence to the optimal policy of the Q-ae learning under deterministic MDPs. The analytical and simulation results illustrate the efficiencies of the Q-ae learning under deterministic and stochastic MDPs.

Title: The multi-parameter combination mind-evolutionary-based machine learning and its application

Abstract: Based on mind-evolutionary-based machine learning (MEBML), four conceptions: degree of interaction, individual similartaxis, group similartaxis and dead band space are defined in this paper. Consequently, the multi-parameter combination mind-evolutionary-based machine learning (MPCMEBML) is established. MPCMEBML can solve efficiently the searching problem of the multi-dimension parameter space. In MDPMEML, the whole parameter space is separated and combined into several sub parameter spaces and the global billboard is endowed with the interactive function. Not every single group searches the whole parameter spaces. Information exchange will supplement the insufficient knowledge that not every group can get by itself. The new fuzzy logic controller is constructed by using MPCMEBML. Simulation results show that MPCMEBML is possessed of a strong ability of searching in the multi-dimension parameter space and the new FLC has good performance.

Title: Reinforcement learning for penalty avoiding policy making

Abstract: Reinforcement learning is a kind of machine learning. It aims to adapt an agent to a given environment with a clue to a reward. In general, the purpose of a reinforcement learning system is to acquire an optimum policy that can maximize expected reward per action. However, it is not always important for any environment. Especially, if we apply reinforcement learning to engineering, we expect the agent to avoid all penalties. In Markov decision processes, we call a rule penalty if and only if it has a penalty or it can transit to a penalty state where it does not contribute to get any reward. After suppressing all penalty rules, we aim to make a rational policy whose expected reward per action is larger than zero. We propose the penalty avoiding rational policy making algorithm that can suppress any penalty as stable as possible and get a reward constantly. By applying the algorithm to the tick-tack-toe its effectiveness is shown.

Title: Refinement of fuzzy production rules by neuro-fuzzy networks

Abstract: The knowledge acquisition bottleneck is well-known in the development of fuzzy knowledge based systems (i.e. FKBSs), and knowledge maintenance and refinement are important issues. The paper improves fuzzy production rule (FPR) representation power by exploiting prior knowledge and develops refinement tools which assist in debugging a FKBS's knowledge, thus easing the knowledge acquisition and maintenance bottlenecks. We focus on knowledge refinement where the FKBS's knowledge is debugged or updated in reaction to evidence that the FKBS is faulty or out-of-date. Some of the applied methods are presented. To select a feasible fuzzy rule set for classification, the most difficult task is finding a set of rules pertaining to the specific classification by choosing adaptive knowledge representation parameters such as local and global weights in fuzzy rules. We map the weighted fuzzy rules to a new neural network (five-layer-based knowledge neural network) so the knowledge representation parameters can be refined and fuzzy rule representation power can be improved. The dynamic assigning neuron method, gradient-descent method with penalizing functions and evolving strategy are considered. We show that this refinement method can maintain the accuracy and improve the comprehensibility and representation power of FPRs. Experiments on a special domain indicate that the refinement method and evolving strategy are able to significantly increase an FPR's representation power when compared with standard fuzzy knowledge-based networks.

Title: Applying evolutionary algorithm in multi-peak decision problems

Abstract: A typical multiple value decision problem, partnership selection in supply chain management, has been introduced as an example, which is difficult to solve when only using traditional multi-objective decision support methods. To take the self-organization simulation model as the basic complex system theory to analyze the complex interactive mode inside the decision support problems, firstly, the paper briefly introduces a machine learning based decision learning strategy, which could automatically lead to the differentiation of different decision rules. Then, for the only learning strategy that could hardly discover the best solutions in quite a large problem space, an evolutionary algorithm (EA) is imported and designed to help the decision rule discovery procedure. It is difficult to combine EA into a real decision scenario in enterprise life. This paper puts forward an integration simulation model and corresponding algorithm structures which result in satisfying outcomes.

Title: Condition monitoring for helicopter data

Abstract: In this paper the classical Westland set of empirical accelerometer helicopter data is analyzed with the aim of condition monitoring for diagnostic purposes. The goal is to determine features for failure events from these data, via a proprietary signal processing toolbox, and to weigh these according to a variety of classification algorithms. As regards signal processing, it appears that the autoregressive (AR) coefficients from a simple linear model encapsulate a great deal of information in a relatively few measurements; it has also been found that augmentation of these by harmonic and other parameters can improve classification significantly. As regards classification, several techniques have been explored, among these restricted Coulomb energy (RCE) networks, learning vector quantization (LVQ), Gaussian mixture classifiers and decision trees. A problem with these approaches, and in common with many classification paradigms, is that augmentation of the feature dimension can degrade classification ability. Thus, we also introduce the Bayesian data reduction algorithm (BDRA), which imposes a Dirichlet prior on training data and is thus able to quantify probability of error in an exact manner, such that features may be discarded or coarsened appropriately.

Title: The evaluating system of human skin surface condition by image processing

Abstract: We propose an automatic evaluation system of human skin surface condition based on subjective evaluation provided by cosmeticians. In the proposed system, image features extracted on the skin image and subjective evaluation by cosmeticians are flexibly connected by using a backpropagation neural network, so that it can automatically estimate human skin surface condition based on subjective evaluation from various skin images. We show some experimental results. Using the trained neural network, human skin surface condition based on subjective evaluation is estimated for unlearned skin images. Then subjective evaluation by this system was compared with that by cosmeticians. Since the proposed system can successfully estimate human skin surface condition like cosmeticians, the effect of the system is demonstrated.

Title: Fuzzy weighted classification rules induction from data

Abstract: One popular approach for automatic generation of fuzzy classification rules is decision tree induction, but almost all of the existing decision tree induction methods have not considered the importance of each proposition in the antecedent (i.e. the weight) contributing to the consequent. Unfortunately, this weight plays an important role in many real world problems. We present an effective approach for learning fuzzy weighted classification rules from data. The weights for each rule antecedent propositions will be assigned based on a relative weight matrix. Some experiments are conducted and the results show that this approach usually can obtain a compact set of fuzzy rules and considerable classification accuracy, especially, the learning accuracy can be improved by incorporating the weight.

Title: State transition rate based reinforcement learning

Abstract: Reinforcement learning is a kind of machine learning that adapts to an environment with special input called a reinforcement signal. An agent using reinforcement learning can obtain purposeful behavior autonomically. However, there are problems in that reinforcement learning takes a long time because it advances while repeating trial-and-error, and an acquired action is not necessarily optimal. We propose reinforcement learning using state transition rates, and compare it with another method. As a result, our method shows the capability of learning purposeful behavior efficiently.

Title: Finding correspondence between visual and auditory events based on perceptual grouping laws across different modalities

Abstract: A human being understands the environment by integrating information obtained by sight, hearing and touch. To integrate information across different senses, a human being must find the correspondence of events observed by different senses. The paper seeks to relate the audio-visual events caused by more than one movement according to general physical laws without object-specific knowledge. As corresponding cues, we use Gestalt's grouping law; simultaneity of the occurrence of sound and change in movement, similarity of time variation between sound and movement, etc. We conducted experiments in a real environment and obtained satisfactory results showing the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Title: Brain model hyper communication mechanisms

Abstract: We propose a totally new communication technique, which is called: brain model hyper communication. The hyper communication technique sends almost all kinds of environmental data, i.e. information of the five senses and more. If people communicate between remote places, they feel as if they are communicating with one another in the same place when using the hyper communication technique. Hyper communication needs two mechanisms: one mechanism is to analyze and divide all data of the environment, and the other mechanism is to integrate and process the data selectively. The human brain analyses many kinds of data about the environment and it integrates data selectively and hierarchically. We modeled the brain processing mechanism, especially the vision mechanism to establish hyper communication. We propose a brain model hyper communication mechanism, which analyses environmental data and integrates it selectively and hierarchically. The brain model hyper communication is based on D.H. Hubel and T.N. Wiesel's (1962) hierarchical model of area V1 neurons.

Title: Giving advice in negotiation using physiological information

Abstract: The authors propose a method for giving advice to participants of negotiation using physiological information. We apply Newcomb's A-B-X model (Isamu Saito, 1987) as a human relation model to negotiation. Based on the model, we adopt the user's preference of a proposal, an impression of an opponent's attitude and a degree of the user's emotional disturbance in the advice generating tool. We measure the user's perspiration and pulse rate to extract the user's emotional disturbance. The tool learns the relation between the user's preferences and the advice. The experimental results show that the tool can improve the quality of advice.

Title: The use of design patterns for the development of multi-agent systems

Abstract: Developers of AI software are normally faced with design challenges involving robustness, efficiency, and extensibility. Most of these challenges at a higher level are independent of the application-specific requirements. Although design patterns have been successfully adopted to tackle these issues, they are rarely documented. Consequently this knowledge remains hidden in the minds of developers or buried within complex system source code. The primary contribution of the paper is to describe an abstract design methodology that can be applied in many (single or) multi-agent systems. The paper mainly illustrates how design patterns can ease the development and increase the efficiency of such systems. As an example, the Essex Wizards multi-agent system is presented which won the third prize in the RoboCup'99 simulator league competition.

Title: Relationship between pain and intersegmental spinal motion characteristics in low-back pain subjects

Abstract: This study was undertaken to determine the relationship between low-back pain and spinal motion. Percutaneous intra-pedicle screws were placed into the right and left L4 (or L5) and S1 segments of nine chronic low-back pain patients. Each of the subjects performed a standard battery of spinal motions including bending in all planes. At the completion of each desired motion, each subject was asked to self-report the pain they experienced on a 10 point scale. The 3D location of markers attached to the pedicle screws was recorded for each motion. Intra- and inter-vertebral motions were calculated. The time series data was reduced to the ranges of motion for each of the tests. A three-layer neural network with fast back-propagation learning algorithm was designed to investigate the relationship between the pain and the motion parameters. This model provided an accurate model for prediction of low-back pain from segmental spinal motion and also offered insights into the mechanisms causing mechanical low-back pain.

Title: Information flow and processing in anticipatory systems

Abstract: Although anticipatory systems are frequently found in many natural phenomena, formal logic and reasoning (by implication) have not been successful in analyzing these systems. Robert Rosen, in his seminal work on anticipatory and complex systems, categorized these systems as those that cannot be modeled by formal reasoning based on implication and further traced their connections to Newtonian formalism where causality is replaced by implication. Rosen demonstrated his modeling relation in the context of mechanics (R. Rosen, 1985; 1991). The author examines information flows in these systems, and explores the system in the communication and computation context. It is concluded that existing communication and computation theories in common with physics/mechanics are missing the "final cause" category defined by Aristotle!.

Title: Modeling EAI-based e-business solutions

Abstract: With increasing Internet use, the selling and buying of goods and services on the Web, commonly considered as a part of e-commerce, is exploding at an unbelievably rapid speed. The success of e-commerce depends a lot on the effort of a contributing domain called e-business that is typically unseen and unconcerned with Web consumers/Web customers, and that is now becoming the focus of every company and its business partners, large and small. The e-commerce therefore is just the tip of the iceberg. Underneath is a huge supporting infrastructure involving the bridging and integration of disparate applications. These applications, old and new, are written in different computer languages and compiled in different platforms, run on different hardware, have different data structures, types and formats, use different transport mechanisms, and support a wide range of different technologies. Consequently, many tools have been introduced in the market over the years to provide rapid development and delivery of integrated applications supporting e-business. While these EAI-enabled applications, pre-packaged software and tools in support of EAI in particular and e-business in general have grown at a highly accelerating rate, methods and techniques for effective and rapid development of EAI and EAI-enabled applications have received a lesser degree of attention. The article discusses an EAI based modeling scheme of e-business solutions for and across enterprises. As a case in point, we use a product suite, namely CandleNet eBusiness Platform by Candle Corporation, to exemplify our modeling scheme.

Title: An agent-based approach for workflow management

Abstract: The authors propose an agent based approach for workflow management, aiming at achieving flexible and dynamic workflow management in the distributed environment. We treat agents as autonomous entities with abilities to solve problems independently and propose an agent hierarchy as well as an agent model. The agent hierarchy consists of three kinds of agents at three neighboring levels: activity agents, role agents and actor agents. With our agent hierarchy, the gap between the dynamic workflow enactment and the static business process model can be bridged. The three levels of agents collaborate with each other through the contract-net approach and the feedback mechanism. Through such collaboration, activity-actor assignments can be achieved flexibly and dynamically; and the workflow execution can be monitored and managed in a real time fashion. The agent model consists of three sub-agents: a message-receiving one, a decision-making one and a message-sending one. Connected by two message queues, these three collaboratively operating sub-agents can complete functions of an agent effectively. Through message transfers of the message-receiving/sending sub-agents and the message based behavior-performing of the decision-making subagent, individual agents as well as the agent hierarchy can operate effectively and efficiently.

Title: Adding numbers with DNA

Abstract: A novel algorithm based on DNA computing for adding binary integer numbers is presented. It requires the unique representation of bits placed in test tubes treated as registers. Amplification step used for the carry operation allows one, in theory, to add numbers with the same quantity of elementary operations, regardless of the number of bits used for representation. New notation proposed in the paper allows for efficient and abstract description of the technical operations on DNA.

Title: Delivery route scheduling method combining knowledge-base with general algorithms

Abstract: To overcome the difficulties in acquiring experts' know-how as well as to realize more efficient deliveries, a delivery route scheduling method that combines a knowledge base with general algorithms is proposed. This method combines the knowledge base and the general algorithms by means of a "conceptual map" of experts' knowledge integrated into the map data, and they are combined using a goal-oriented knowledge architecture with a user interface, where the goal and its achievement strategies are selectable. Due to such a combination of flexible and selectable knowledge, this method can automatically generate efficient delivery routes, which are also safe, considerate of the residents and their environment, and/or respect the precedented routes. This method basically interfaces between the AI part and the general algorithm part only by way of the above-mentioned "conceptual map" data. The general algorithm part does not need to be modified if expertise, areas and times change. As a result, the system using this method can be easily extended and/or modified to be used, for example, in various areas from over-populated super-cities to countryside conservation. The proposed method can be generally applied to delivery route generation for parcels, mail, packages and parts necessary for production or maintenance.

Title: Issue formulation in a multi-actor context: a five-step approach

Abstract: Problem formulation is one of the most crucial steps in any systems engineering effort. This paper describes a five-step approach to systems problem formulation in which the different crucial aspects are addressed consecutively. The approach first emphasizes (1) the analysis of a problem's context and (2) the formulation of objectives, as this may significantly affect the system boundary and the spectrum of alternatives taken into account. Next, (3) an actor and dependency analysis and (4) an uncertainty analysis follow, which contribute to (5) adjustments to the system boundary and enrichment of the criteria and alternatives to be considered. The essence of each step and the use of simple, conceptual methods is illustrated using an example.

Title: A new algorithm and simulation for computing optimal paths in a dynamic and weighted 2-D environment

Abstract: Presents a new method for determining optimal paths in a weighted and dynamic 2D environment, together with some simulation results. After mapping the dynamic and weighted 2D environment onto a static 3D space-time workspace, we represent the 3D workspace by a weighted and framed octree (wf-octree), and find optimal paths in the weighted and dynamic 2D environment by propagating a diamond-shaped path planning wave in the 3D workspace through the uniformly weighted leaf nodes of the wf-octree. A wave propagation heap is introduced to control the process of the wave propagation. Based on interesting data-structural and computational geometric techniques, our approach propagates the path-planning wave through each uniformly-weighted and framed octant efficiently. Our approach guarantees the optimality of the resulting paths without requiring the entire static 3D space-time workspace to be searched. Therefore, it is much more efficient than other commonly-used cell decomposition methods such as the grid-based ones, while it achieves at least the same accuracy as other cell decomposition methods. The distance we compute is based on the L/sub 1/ or L/sub /spl infin// metric.

Title: A heuristic Gupta-based flexible flow-shop scheduling algorithm

Abstract: In simple flow-shop problems, each machine operation center includes just one machine. If at least one machine center includes more than one machine, the scheduling problem becomes a flexible flow-shop problem. Flexible flow-shops can thus be thought of as generalizations of simple flow-shops. C. Sriskandarajah and S.P. Sethi (1989) proposed a heuristic algorithm for solving flexible flow-shop problems for two machine centers. In this paper, we extend their algorithm to solve flexible flow-shop problems for more than two machine centers. The heuristic Gupta algorithm is adopted as the kernel for achieving this purpose. Since this problem is NP-complete, optimal solutions seem unnecessary, especially when the number of jobs is large.

Title: Robust division of temporal horizons in production planning

Abstract: In production systems, those responsible for decisions on scheduling are compelled to manipulate the temporal planning horizon efficiently. Dividing the horizon into adjacent intervals facilitates workload regulation and the scheduling of operations, by helping to determine the coherence between the operating plan and real shop capacity constraints. The methodology proposed in this paper aids decisions on scheduling and workload regulation by making them part of a robust planning horizon, which allows for the largest possible margin of autonomy.

Title: A linear time transform for probability aware planning

Abstract: Presents a transform that enables traditional shortest-feasible-plan planners to reason about uncertain operators and produce plans which have higher probabilities of success. This transform converts a probability-aware domain description into a STRIPS-style description, where the probability of success is expressed by the plan length. Using this transformed description, a plan can be generated by a traditional planner. The transform is shown to be at worst linear in the size of the input, and allows the planning system to trade-off accuracy against runtime as an anytime computation.

Title: A method for solving nested combinatorial optimization problems - a case of optimizing a large-scale distribution network

Abstract: The optimization of a large-scale distribution network is considered to be a nested combinatorial problem consisting of the following steps: (1) the decision about part delivery volume per part manufacturer; (2) the decision about depots and trucks for the transportation of parts; and (3) the generation of delivery routes for each truck. In such a nested combinatorial problem, a high-level and mathematically strict optimization is desirable as the first step. In addition, at each step, human multi-sided inspection is desired, which requires interactive simulation. Thus, for the first step, a method using linear programming (LP) is proposed. For the second and third steps, a method using a genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed. The latter guarantees interactive responsiveness and realizes expert-level accuracy, through enabling the solution of 1000 mid-scale traveling salesman problems (TSPs) for a distribution network within 30 seconds and within a 3% error. Experimental results proved that the proposed method enables the optimization of a nationwide large-scale distribution network.

Title: Fuzzy scheduling of a flexible assembly line through an evolutionary algorithm

Abstract: In final assembly line operations, mixed-model lines allow one to reach different objectives, such as minimization of the line stop time (a productivity goal) and the component fluctuation (a JIT goal). This paper deals with product sequencing in mixed-model assembly lines, approaching the problem from a unique point of view: the minimization of the line stop time. Usually, such an analysis is performed through an approximate procedure because the problem data (i.e. the processing times) are estimated as deterministic values, but in real production this is a strong simplification; in fact, very often in a production environment, the data are vague, imprecise or uncertain. Then, the input data can be only estimated with a certain amount of uncertainty. When such uncertainty is primarily due to vagueness, it can usefully be formalized by using fuzzy mathematical tools. Such an approach in uncertainty modeling requires new methods for dealing with scheduling problems when the data are fuzzy. This paper proposes a new methodology for fuzzy scheduling in mixed-model assembly lines. Moreover, the object of the research is not only concentrated on fuzzy scheduling problem formalization but also on its optimization through proper powerful heuristic search tool developments, such as genetic algorithms and simulated annealing.

Title: An application of situation theory

Abstract: A set-theoretical model of interactive processes, called DPC, is described by T. Scheurer (2000). The purpose of the paper is to present an application which is very general: it is the distributed production of software through a team of programmers working independently of one another. This process is described as consisting of a set of partially concurrent subprocesses. These are not known individually beforehand: they arise dynamically, each in response to the outcome of previous ones. The main purpose of the paper is to show how this overall process is modelled by DPC. To keep the application simple, we assume that it is concerned with the construction of any program in a procedural language like Pascal or C++.

Title: Towards a standard for model specification and storage

Abstract: Software production has become an industrial task usually involving teams of programmers working on complex problems to produce large, even huge software systems. Globally distributed teams are doing a growing share of all software development work. The management of software engineering teamwork, especially of a temporally and/or spatially distributed team, presents an enormous organizational challenge as well as an intricate technical problem, as such distributed teamwork requires tool support for coordination of cooperative activities, maintenance of project control, and sharing of information. Domain-specific Model Integrated Program Synthesis environments are created according to a modeling paradigm: a description of the class of models that can be created using the system. Just as model integrated computing applications are executable instances of domain models, domain models can be viewed as instances of metamodels. The representation of these models and the modeling paradigm is unique to the specific modeling environment. This poses a major problem for portability of models from one modeling environment to another. The purpose of the paper is to explore the possibility of a common standard for the storage of models, in what framework the standard should exist, and who should define the standard.

Title: A digital library system with mechanisms of collaboration support

Abstract: The paper describes the importance of collaboration support for a digital library. Collaboration among users is required in an ordinary library. Users of a digital library can utilize advanced collaboration functions which are supported by computer systems. Four types of user in a digital library are defined: customers who utilize information from documents in libraries; reference librarians who support customers and maintain reference materials; catalog librarians who gather, organize and register documents; and providers who create, edit and publish documents. We study collaborations among these kinds of users such as collaborative searching, collaborative reading, shared glossaries, collaborative registration, and question and answer databases. We have developed a prototype of a digital library system with collaboration support mechanisms.

Title: Situation theory - a formal model of interactive processes

Abstract: Many dynamic systems may be described as collections of 'elementary activities' that are partly independent of one another. Their execution may allow a degree of concurrency, subject to precedence constraints. These systems are referred to as interactive processes. This paper presents a general set-theoretical model of interactive processes called DPC (distributed planning and control). A DPC process is described as an object with three types of feature: situations, events and residual domains (RDs). A situation is any condition that persists over an uninterrupted period of time. An event is defined by the property that it terminates a set of situations and starts a new set of situations. A RD is a set of alternative events resulting from a set of co-existing situations. It is defined by the fact that to know that it has occurred is to know that exactly one of its members will occur in the future. The paper first gives an intuitive description of DPC. It then introduces a simple notation, called feature notation (FN), that is devised for the description of large set-theoretical models. A formal model of DPC is then established in FN. Finally, DPC is briefly related to other similar models: the process calculus CCS, coloured Petri nets and the decision trees and activity networks of operations research.

Title: Multiple-value decision supporting application in software production facing global market

Abstract: Information technology has put enterprises into global competition, and the process of preparing global software products is being abundantly discussed everywhere. Decision-makers find that various kinds of decision problems are emerging in this process; thus, decision support systems (DSS) are playing an important role in this area. This paper introduces a DSS which can be applied by small-to-medium-sized (SM) software companies already holding a marketable product and facing the challenges of the global market. A multiple-value analysis-based model is introduced to assess multi-objective, intangible impacts, uncertainty and ill-posed problems that SM software companies might be able of responding to within a continuously changing and unpredictable environment. A three-layer DSS framework for software production in the face of a global market is first introduced. Then, a general value model tree can help to better organize the value deployment of the system. Further research concerning real decision scenarios is presented and progressed after this.

Title: Fuzzy controlled resonant DC-DC converters

Abstract: The main purpose of the paper is to demonstrate the powerful property of a fuzzy inversion technique described earlier. A member of a new generation of a resonant DC-DC converter family is selected as controlled object. It is a dual channel step down converter. To demonstrate the powerful property of the fuzzy inversion technique, a fuzzy control process was applied in a simulation environment. The effectiveness of control theory applying the approximation of the inverse model is proved through the results of simulation.

Title: Prediction of the hydrologic behavior of a watershed using artificial neural networks and geographic information systems

Abstract: The authors have been working on the modeling and simulation of environmental systems. We have developed an object oriented approach mainly based on discrete events and object oriented simulation. In order to validate our approach, we applied it to the simulation of watershed behavior; the results were quite satisfactory. However, a more accurate rainfall/runoff model is necessary in order to take into account hourly flow variations, particularly for flood prediction. As our first approach was not efficient enough to do this, we chose to define a new one based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) and geographic information systems (GIS) paradigms.

Title: Scalability of ELISIMS: comprehensive detailed simulation of the electric power industry

Abstract: We conduct an experimental analysis to identify the most computational time consuming fragments of software and hardware that will likely be an integral part of power exchanges in a deregulated environment. The empirical analysis provides insights into the scalability of the system as a function of branch congestion, excess/scarcity of power, average size of multi-lateral contracts, and topology and size of networks. Additionally they yield insights into the reliability, security and stability of electrical networks.

Title: Integrating information systems in electric utilities

Abstract: The paper presents an integration system, ISIS, developed for electric utilities, on top of which decision support tools can be cost-effectively developed and integrated with other information systems commonly present in electric utilities. The system, called the Integrated Distribution Management System (IDMS), provides an easily configurable integration framework, and currently includes one decision support tool, a diagnostics component. The diagnostics component, called the Outage Restoration Management Server (ORMS) is integrated with other information systems via a flexible, extensible integration framework (IF), based on model integrated computing (MIC) technology developed at the Institute for Software Integrated Systems (ISIS). The IF was designed such that 1) the integration between the decision support tools and the utility information system can be easily maintained, and 2) additional decision support tools can be created and integrated into the IDMS quickly and inexpensively. The MIC based IF provides a flexible and extensible integration platform on which can be built a suite of decision support tools that will help utilities run their businesses more effectively and efficiently.

Title: Fitting fuzzy membership functions using genetic algorithms

Abstract: Using fuzzy logic to solve control problems has increased considerably. This makes the teaching of fuzzy control in engineering courses an urgent issue. Therefore, a self-training computer package in fuzzy control theory for students was developed previously. The package has all the necessary instructions for understanding all principles of fuzzy control. The training instructions are given through an application drill. Though this approach proved to be effective, by giving students a way of understanding an actual situation, it has a limitation: the learning method itself. The students always use the "trial-and-error" method to arrive to an adequate control action. The problem with this method is that students may be driven to the wrong conclusion that fuzzy control system corrections are but a matter of supposition. The purpose of the paper is to present a strategy for the automatic adjustment of membership functions using genetic algorithms.

Title: Using active networking for congestion control in high-speed networks with self-similar traffic

Abstract: Various papers have discussed the impact of burstiness on network congestion. Their conclusions are that congested periods can be quite long with packet losses that are heavily concentrated. Several conventional methods have been implemented to avoid congestion, such as traffic shaping, end-to-end feedback congestion control systems, etc. These methods are not responsive enough to the varying bandwidth and network delay caused by bursty traffic. The objective of the paper is to describe a new algorithm to avoid congestion without the negative effects of traditional methods. A model developed under Compuware's COMNET, the discrete event simulation system, illustrates the algorithm. The model is based on real traffic collected in an ATM network.

Title: Hybrid simplex genetic algorithm for blind equalization using RBF networks

Abstract: The purpose of the paper is to derive a simplex genetic algorithm (GA) for blind equalization using RBF networks. In order to reduce the computation cost, this algorithm searches the center's elements instead of centers because of the inter-relation between the centers. Furthermore, by introducing the simplex operator into the GA, the proposed algorithm presents a fast convergence characteristic in simulation.

Title: Authentication of cellular users through voice verification

Abstract: The paper discusses a speaker verification technique that was developed to battle fraud, a common problem that the cellular operating companies have to deal with. The technique uses the user voice to perform authentication. By comparing a live voiceprint with reference voiceprints, a speaker verifier determines whether the user is "legitimate" (voiceprints match) or an "imposter" (voiceprints do not match). Speaker verification can be used as an extra layer of protection against fraud, when used with authentication that uses mathematical algorithms and fraud pin code, or as a complete substitute because a voice is unique to a person and is hard to duplicate.

Title: The method of kinetic typography communication

Abstract: Kinetic typography is a character animation methodology operated by computer. Motion character implies its own language together with feeling and tone of voice. The study proposes a communication mail system applied to kinetic typography. Dependent on our precedent research, kinetic typography can show a kind of Kansei information with dynamic motion grammar. Kinetic typography could be useful for expressing a short private message for a greeting or question. We grasped some elements of dynamic motion through factor analysis for Kansei words, and looked at a dynamic motion engine system for kinetic typography. We developed a kinetic communication system to apply the kinetic motion engine, and proposed a prototype operating on a Web browser. It equips the dynamic motion engine and the grammar, and can generate kinetic typography. Senders can choose from several types of motion what they would like to express. Receivers can revive the kinetic typography in the mail on their own browser. The prototype of this system will give us a vision for Kansei communication with kinetic typography.

Title: On a methodology for designing adaptive local area networks

Abstract: Local area networks (LAN) are subject to crashes. If a communication link goes down or a server crashes, services provided by the network become unavailable. To provide fault tolerant and fault resilient network services, LANs are required to be adaptive and reconfigurable so that they can recover from crashes by reconfiguring themselves. The paper presents an application of the adaptive team design methodology on computer networks to design adaptive reconfigurable local area networks.

Title: InfoFlo: a novel communication infrastructure for personal digital assistants

Abstract: Personal digital assistants (PDAs) are becoming commonplace, and feature continually increasing processing and storage capabilities. Distribution of media through wireless means to these devices is becoming less expensive, but is not yet widespread. The authors describe a novel communication infrastructure to provide distribution of information to PDAs utilizing inexpensive methods; our approach is both scalable and flexible. Most PDAs support infrared (IR) communication, and we focus on this; our infrastructure is not restricted to this, however, and is adaptable to the emerging wireless communication technologies.

Title: Location tracking in a mobile communication environment

Abstract: To support mobility management in a mobile communication environment, a universal browser based ndhu-View management system was designed. Besides the traditional management functions, the ndhu-View system extends to the capabilities of location tracking. Java facilities and SNMP-compatible MIB were defined and utilized to build the ndhu-View interfaces and operations. A /spl pi/-calculus analytical model was developed for bringing out the mobility feature. From the prototype system, the ndhu-View system can achieve a high degree of efficiency in stationary-mobile communication management with extended capabilities and traditional management functions.

Title: Blind nonlinear channel identification based on higher order statistics using hybrid genetic algorithm

Abstract: A method with 4th-order cumulant is proposed for nonlinear channel identification. Compared with the conventional method which uses 3rd-order cumulant, the proposed method does not need to use any constraints. Since the cost function with higher order statistics has local minima, we also propose to use a hybrid genetic algorithm (GA) to minimize the cost function. The applicability of the proposed method is demonstrated by computer simulations.

Title: Modeling agent negotiation

Abstract: A multi-agent system (MAS) is a cooperation focused implementation of multiple programs (agents) that coordinate with each other to attempt to converge on the solution to one or more tasks. Agent negotiation is the convergence upon this solution through compromise and communication. Currently, the implementation of agents is highly dependent on the programming language, and any perspective to the negotiation methods agents use to achieve goals and tasks are drawn after the implementation phase of the development. A better solution to the development of agent interaction is to model the negotiation interaction on a high level, and produce from that model the implementation. Model-Integrated Computing (MIC) and Model-Integrated Program Synthesis (MIPS) are two tools which may be used toward the implementation of such a method.

Title: An agent-based scheme for interference cancellation in a DS/CDMA system

Abstract: DS/CDMA has been proposed as a multiple access scheme suitable for future mobile communication systems. CDMA with a conventional matched filter detector is affected by the near-far problem where there are high-powered users. To support the high quality of service in a fading environment, many mechanisms using multi-user detection schemes are proposed. Based on these existing mechanisms and a distributed artificial intelligence technique, we propose a distributed multi-agent scheme to assist CDMA system managers with interference cancellation. The scheme consists of a collection of problem-solving agents, and there are three key modules including knowledge source, blackboard system, and control engine which were built in the scheme. Performance comparisons between our scheme and other heuristics were derived from random traffic patterns. Extensive simulations show that the proposed scheme significantly reduced the bit-error-rate (BER) in CDMA networks and dramatically improves the connection blocking performance.

Title: Probabilistic networks for verifying automated testing of high speed telecommunication equipment through the development lifecycle

Abstract: Learning probabilistic networks for expert system applications has seen a great surge of research activity in recent years. The paper reports on the adoption of probabilistic networks for verifying the pass/fail result of automated testing at the software verification stage in the development lifecycle of high-speed telecommunications equipment. The focus is on learning Bayesian belief networks (BBNs) from automated test data on a per test execution basis. This facilitates result classification and assurance, taking advantage of their graphical nature to provide accountability for the decision.

Title: Just-in-time weather in the synthetic natural environment

Abstract: Military mission rehearsals and virtual prototypes increasingly rely upon combat simulations to predict feasibility and success. The current US force projection doctrine requires these operations to be conducted anywhere, anytime, and under any conditions. Standard scenarios provide accurate location data, but generally lack realistic weather conditions that can easily reverse the fortunes of war. This paper describes an approach to bring realistic weather to combat simulations by merging historical archives, engineering-level mobility and detection models, and simulation databases into a robust synthetic natural environment. The conduit is the Simulation-Weather interface Module (SWIM), a Java-based tool set connecting simulations and their managers via the World Wide Web. This work allows analysts and planners to accurately determine and plan for weather conditions in any part of the world at any time. It also enables reliable what-if scenarios for mission rehearsal by forecasting operational weather, which can then be customized by the planner. The Web-based interface allows scenarios to be revised via the Internet from anywhere in the world.

Title: Design of the Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and Target Acquisition Squadron for the US Army's Interim Brigade Combat Team

Abstract: The primary source of battlespace intelligence for the Army's proposed Interim Brigade Combat Team (BCT) is the Reconnaissance, Surveillance and Target Acquisition (RSTA) Squadron. The fundamental role of the RSTA Squadron is to provide detailed situational understanding to the BCT Commander facilitating freedom to maneuver and the concentration of combat power at the decisive time and place. Technologically advanced systems should substantially enhance RSTA Squadron operations. Among the proposed systems in the Squadron are the Future Scout and Cavalry System (FSCS), tactical unmanned aerial vehicles (TUAVs), ground-based networked sensors (acoustic, seismic, magnetic, IR and RF), RF detectors, and nuclear, biological and chemical (NBC) reconnaissance systems. This paper outlines the process used to date for designing the RSTA Squadron and proposes an alternative approach: a systems engineering methodology to formulate, analyze and interpret RSTA Squadron design alternatives.

Title: Joint military headquarters redesign

Abstract: In the past decade, the focus of our military forces has shifted from a major theater of war to many types of operations other than war, including peace-making, peace-keeping and humanitarian support. Current headquarters elements that command and control such forces have, at best, only made marginal changes in organization and structure to adapt themselves to new missions and new technologies. This paper presents the application of systems engineering methods to re-engineer our military forces' command and control systems around the flow of information to facilitate decision-making and to enhance military force effectiveness. The focus of our re-engineering effort is designing systems for accomplishing high-level headquarters functions. The key functions that a headquarters must perform are informing, deciding and implementing decisions, all designed around the efficient flow of information.

Title: Transmission rate manager for fuzzy traffic control of ATM network

Abstract: The paper presents methods for the improvement of performance of a fuzzy traffic controller that simultaneously manages congestion control and connection admission control for an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) network. An ATM network requires a sophisticated, real time traffic controller that manages connection admission control and congestion control, to guarantee the quality of service (QOS) for existing calls and to achieve high system utilization. We introduce a new rule set for the congestion control part of the fuzzy traffic controller and add a transmission rate manager to adjust source rates of data traffic. Simulation results show that the total system utilization improves from 69% to 98.5% and cell loss probability reduces from 2.9 e-3 to 1.85 e-5.

Title: Designing an OOTW decision support system for military planners

Abstract: The intelligence community must provide relevant, timely intelligence to support operations other than war (OOTW). Recently, OOTW have become an increasing challenge to military planners. The intelligence community does not know with certainty where or when future OOTW will occur, what the operations will involve, when they will occur, or how much advance warning will be provided. To prudently deal with these challenges, the US Army's National Ground Intelligence Center (NGIC) has developed a plan to systematically identify knowledge needs to support future OOTW. We present our preliminary knowledge hierarchy for the collection of intelligence information to help national security planners prepare for future OOTW. We developed a prototype to accept user input on alternative deployment locations and value assessments for criteria from the knowledge hierarchy to determine the best location. For a specific location, criteria receiving a score below a threshold generate a needed capability for the deploying unit. By analyzing locations that could serve as military areas of operations, the prototype answers the questions as to where to deploy and what to bring. This system represents the first attempt to use intelligence information in a decision support system that specifically addresses the needs of OOTW planners at multiple levels of command.

Title: Effectiveness of social systems sustained by residents' participation: a collection system of classified garbage and rubbish

Abstract: Models the decision mechanism by residents on their contribution to garbage and rubbish classification, and clarifies how they decide to (or not to) cooperate with the system. Moreover, based on the model and survey results, effective management policies for the system for better classification are examined. More precisely, the decision by residents to cooperate with garbage classification is modeled as a game between each resident and his/her society, consisting of the residents in the region. A mailing survey for residents in the eastern Tottori area and an interview visit to the garbage disposal facility of the Tottori Eastern Local Government Association are provided in order to collect actual data on the garbage classification level of the residents. From this study, it is clarified that the three policies of (1) public announcements, (2) education, and (3) incentive systems (punishment and subsidy) have different effects on the cooperation of households. An appropriate policy mix is necessary in order to effectively achieve the cooperation of the majority. In particular, policies (1) and (3) have different effects on cooperation, depending on how they are mixed. The model developed in this study can be used to examine policies for a more effective garbage classification system.

Title: Project risk allocation through contingent cost allocation

Abstract: In a joint project, the project cost is allocated to the participants. How to allocate the cost has been discussed mainly in cooperative game theory assuming that the cost is certain. If the project cost is uncertain, each participant is exposed to the risk of allocated cost. Thus the risk should be allocated according to the risk acceptance level for each participant. For this risk allocation, a stochastic cooperative game is useful rather than a cooperative game based on the certainty of cost. We develop a contingent cost allocation scheme in which the risk is transferred mutually in order to attain efficient risk allocation by a stochastic cooperative game. As a result, the efficient risk allocation is derived so that all participants are better off than the allocation which does not transfer the risk mutually.

Title: A neural network based, real-time algorithm for detection and mitigation of pilot induced oscillations

Abstract: A neural network-based pilot-induced oscillations (PIO) detection algorithm and a PIO compensation method were shown to be highly effective during a series of piloted simulations. During PIO, the aircraft oscillates in a manner that is out of phase with the pilot's control inputs. The pilot is not aware when PIO are driven by pilot-aircraft coupling, so he may continue driving the oscillations in an ineffective attempt to stop them. PIO have caused a significant number of aircraft accidents.

Title: Modeling public conflicts over infrastructure renewal using a Japanese case study

Abstract: In conflicts over large-scale infrastructure projects, public opinion may influence the preference structure of the players as they communicate with the general public who are considered to be outside of the game. We deal with the particular kind of conflict which allows for players' communication with the outside public which we shall call the public-open conflict. The major objective is to illustrate an example of a public-open conflict in an infrastructure project, by systematically examining a Japanese case study called the conflict over the Daiju-zeki (Daiju-weir) renewal project on the Yoshino River, Japan.

Title: Risk in quality violations under uncertainty

Abstract: Violation of water quality conditions occurs whenever levels of a contaminant exceed an established standard. Preventive measures are frequently introduced to reduce frequency of failures. This paper applies reliability analysis to examine stream water quality conditions. Satisfactory water quality condition means tolerating failure at an acceptable rate. Failures are random events, and to achieve long-term environmental benefit one would expect observed reliability to be higher than the required reliability. Likewise, an average time between failures should be several times the required average time between failures.

Title: Case-based reasoning support system for conflict modeling

Abstract: The implementation and testing of a case-based reasoning system for conflict resolution is presented. The issues of case representation, case storage, case retrieval and case reuse are considered. Information on 104 conflict cases that have been analyzed using a methodology called the graph model for conflict resolution is collected and stored. The system is first tested and verified using the case base and then the system's ability to retrieve similar cases is evaluated.

Title: A simulation perspective on knowledge management and sharing, and conflict and complexity in social systems management

Abstract: There are many contemporary situations today where conflict potential is a reality. In a very large number of these situations simple patterns, resulting from the aggregation of recurring individual actions and responses, can lead to extremely complex social behaviors. Often, there are misperceptions and miss beliefs concerning these behaviors and this can create a conflict potential that is dysfunctional for groups and societies. Knowledge sharing is generally beneficial in these situations. It would be highly desirable to be able to create models that will accurately predict the outcomes of these complex systems for various knowledge sharing options. In general, this cannot be done. We can, however, often create models that will accurately simulate the processes the system uses to create outputs. The major constructs associated with such models are: the interactions and feedback relations between the various agents whose choices depend upon the decisions of others; and linearity and return to scale considerations. There are many implications associated with these models. Among them are questions of steady state versus continued evolutionary behavior, the nature and possibility of time-invariant processes, and questions of path dependence. We discuss the use of complex adaptive system perspectives to support simulation models that represent social systems management approaches to enhance knowledge sharing in organizations.

Title: Reliable judgement for gray-zone in monitoring system

Abstract: This paper discusses a safety monitoring system design that consists of sensors with gray zone signal outputs, where the gray zone signal expresses no judgement for situations of uncertainty. This type of sensor is expected to prevent model-induced failures that may be induced by a failure to alarm or by generating false alarms, since the model-induced failures occur in the gray zone. Our problem of interest is in determining the optimal judgement method for the gray zone. Firstly, one-sensor system with three-value outputs is analyzed, and under certain conditions the two-step judgement method utilizing information from another sensor only for gray zone outputs are shown to be better than both deterministic and stochastic judgement. Secondly, a heterogeneous type of sensor system model is introduced where a judgement of safety or danger is always made after integrating information from a two-value sensor that monitors another characteristic of the real state. Lastly, it is suggested that these monitoring models are applicable to the analysis of the human collaboration problem.

Title: Design and implementation of a personalized service management system

Abstract: In this paper, based upon the Object-Oriented Rule-based Model (OO-RM), a personalized service management system (PSMS) is designed and implemented in which the desired services can be provided for all customers and users' personal information can be properly managed. Besides, the charging models describing the costs of all services, which may be different for different users, also have been included in PSMS. By applying the object-oriented techniques, new services and new users can be increased easily without changing the architecture of whole system.

Title: The optimal repairing rules under demand risk

Abstract: This paper focuses upon the optimal repairing rules of public systems under demand uncertainty. An optimal impulse control model is formulated to determine the optimal sequence of impulse timing: and the recovery policy to minimize the present values of expected life cycle costs. The optimal repairing rules can be formulated as a set of adaptive state-dependent rules. The repairing rules can be applied based upon updated observations about service levels of systems. A numerical example illustrates how adaptive rules can be calculated in a given demand environment.

Title: A real-time visual inspection system for automated prescription dispensing

Abstract: We present an image processing system that is designed to confirm the correctness of automated prescription orders, without any special pill handling or barcodes, using only a PC equipped with a frame grabber and an overhead camera. Training consists of averaging several categories of features (color, shape, texture, glossiness, and markings) from multiple image samples of each target pill type. During online operation, this system extracts sets of features from the sample pill image and eliminates pill types from the candidate list whose features are outside certain tolerances from the expected target pill. If there is exactly one candidate left, and that candidate is the target pill type, then the sample is accepted as correct. If there is more than one candidate left, or if the target pill type has been pruned out of the candidate list, then the sample is sent to pharmacists for manual verification.

Title: Decision analysis for mitigating natural disaster risks

Abstract: This paper aims at developing a methodology of decision analysis for mitigating natural disaster risks arising with low probability for which the expected utility theory of von Neumann and Morgenstern (1947) is inadequate. It is shown that the value function under risk is a useful model for evaluating public risks of extreme events that influence numerous people enormously or the environment badly with low probability.

Title: On the perceived speed of time over time

Abstract: "I don't believe it: another year has flown by-it seems that time is going by at an ever-faster rate."" This often expressed perception of time, the speed of time, is both qualitatively and quantitatively explored. While the speed of time is clearly invariant (at least on earth and at traveling speeds that are orders of magnitude below the speed of light), there is ample and plausible evidence that serves to contribute to our perception of a faster moving time. More specifically, it seems that both nature and nurture impact or influence our perception of time and the speed of time. In this exploratory study, we have briefly reviewed the cognition and related literature to understand why the older we get, the more we perceive the speed of time to increase - there is a clinical reason for this aging phenomenon. We then showed that environmental or experiential factors can also effect our perceived speed of time. Indeed, although the results should be considered preliminary, our analysis suggests that the nurture-related experience may have a stronger impact on our perceived speed of time than the nature-related perception (i.e., due to aging).

Title: Train operation with arranging conflicts between commuters and travelers in railroad transport to and from a metropolitan airport

Abstract: Existing railroad lines for commuters and shoppers are sometimes used for access to an airport from a metropolitan area. If express trains run on such a line, conflicts arise between the convenience of regular users and airport users. This study considers how to operate trains in order to resolve the conflicts in railroad services to and from an airport. We first interview commuters on factors such as fares, congestion, speed, frequency, and choice of type of train, and formulate a discrete choice model for commuters with respect to a line to Chubu International Airport (under construction). Discrete choice models are certainly useful for explaining individual choice behavior but mutually affecting behavior is not revealed explicitly. Then, we make an aggregate analysis of train choice for the two types of users. The results suggest how to provide a fair and efficient service on the airport railroad line.

Title: Prediction of lake inflows with neural networks

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of integrating the effects of climate history and solar variability, to enhance regional hydrologic forecasting using neural networks. A previous attempt at modeling the inflow to Lake Okeechobee employed a multilayered perceptron (see Trimble et al, 1998). While the resulting model was able to capture some regularities of the measured inflow, it was far from being a useful predictive model. We continue the lake inflow modeling effort by examining data representation, quadratic input transformations, and time-delay neural networks.

Title: Towards accessible synchronous communication

Abstract: We present two synchronous communication systems, a video-mediated communication system called PEBBLES, and accessible, text-based communication tools called JAMTalk. PEBBLES combines video-conferencing with simple robotics to link a child in the hospital with his/her regular school. JAMTalk tools provide accessible real-time communication tools for distance education. We suggest that results from PEBBLES and JAMTalk evaluations indicate that accessible electronic communication systems can provide unique advantages to students with disabilities.

Title: Adding haptics and sound to spatial curriculum

Abstract: A large number of learners with disabilities (e.g., blindness, learning disabilities) rely heavily on touch and tactile manipulation to take in information. This information or mode of control is not available in distance education delivery systems to date. The purpose of the research was to explore the expression of spatial concepts such as geography using several non-visual modalities including haptics, 3D real world sounds, and speech, and to determine the optimal assignment of the available modalities to different types of information. The ultimate goal is to integrate these modalities into curriculum delivered at a distance and in the classroom, thereby benefiting students with and without disabilities.

Title: Self-organization simulation and output analysis

Abstract: A three-layer self-organization simulation framework is introduced, which could be regarded as the basic idea to simulate self-organizing behavior. Then, a complete self-organization simulation model is introduced in detail, which is enhanced by both machine learning and evolutionary algorithms from the AI area. To give an application perspective, a prototype system, called "SOS-PS" (Self-Organization Simulation in Partnership Selection) is proposed. Using the self-organization simulation model, the prototype system can give valuable decision support for complex partnership selection problems in virtual enterprises.

Title: Multiattribute utility theory applied on analysis of alternative for 500kv transmission lines building

Abstract: This paper presents a multicriteria decision model to support decision maker choices regarding alternatives of building power transmission lines. The decision model aggregates different objectives through an additive utility function taking into account the appropriate independence utility conditions of multiattribute utility theory. Several aspects regarding cost and scheduling commitment have been taken into account. These attributes are aggregated trough an additive utility function. Also, aspects related to the behavior of the decision maker regarding risk (aversion, neutral and prone) are formulated within the decision model. A case study based on a real situation is analyzed. A sensitivity analysis illustrates the robustness of the theory. The case study is concerned with a decision maker choice regarding alternatives to building a 500kV power transmission line, crossing over a 230kV transmission line in operation. Several attributes related to cost and scheduling commitment are aggregated trough a multiattribute utility function and the behaviors of the decision maker regarding risk are formulated within the decision model. The paper presents the mathematical formulation of the decision model.

Title: Self-organization based DSS framework

Abstract: This paper presents a new decision support system (DSS) framework based on the self-organization principle, which offers flexibility and rationality in a complex enterprise environment. Firstly, the complexity of the current decision environment is analyzed. Then, the decision procedure model and its general dynamic state equation model are introduced. As the order-parameter is a key concept in the self-organization principle, the paper gives a diagrammatic strategy for DSS modeling, which divides the DSS solution methodology into both an order-parameter abstraction and a rule propagation procedure. The fractal data structure of the DSS is explained. Furthermore, a self-organization simulation model is introduced, which is the core of the new DSS framework, and which results in an advanced decision support strategy.

Title: Participative process modelling

Abstract: This paper motivates and illustrates a new approach to providing computer support for participative modelling of processes, and for modelling participative processes. This approach relies upon constructing computer-based artefacts that serve an explanatory role. The construction of such artefacts proceeds in a distributed and incremental fashion in association with the development of a working understanding amongst the participants engaged in process comprehension and design. The approach to computer-based modelling is illustrated with reference to work in progress on modelling the processes of warehouse operation.

Title: Interfacing a simulation engine to an embedded runtime environment

Abstract: The design of modern high-performance embedded systems is challenging. Power and size constraints limit hardware size, while performance requirements demand algorithm-specific architectures. A model-integrated approach can be used in the design capture and synthesis of these systems. A domain-specific graphical system design environment allows the capture of system requirements, design information and alternatives, and of available processing resources in the form of models. A model interpretation process generates architecture specifications and compilable code. A typical first step in designing complex systems is to develop a simulation-based prototype. After functional verification of the prototype, system components are implemented, each tailored to a particular target platform. Only after all components are implemented can system integration be addressed, often uncovering inconsistencies between components and forcing costly redesign. This paper describes an extension of a model-integrated design environment and runtime system. Simulation-based components are included in system models. A simulation engine is interfaced to a runtime environment, allowing simulation components to run in the loop with nonsimulation based components. The extended environment allows prototype synthesis from system models and automates the integration of implemented components into the system. Further, the extended environment provides the designer with a powerful visualization and debugging tool.

Title: An integrated creative reminding algorithm

Abstract: Automation of creative thinking is very important as well as very difficult. Research shows that creative thinking is a very complicated dynamical system. We first prove that the variation of any feature of this system is able to reflect the dynamic information of the whole system. Based on this, we give a method of how to measure the reminded objects so that the measure sequence can be constructed which is proved to be chaotic. It follows that we present a creative reminding method according to chaos theory. This method is built on the prediction by a Lyapunov exponent calculated on the thinking history, which consists of the exponent calculation, exponent reminding mode, etc. We present a comprehensive reminding algorithm consisting of the usual and fantastic parts. When the relevance of the target to the given base is bigger than the given threshold the target is to be reminded, or else a simulated annealing-based algorithm is applied to make a decision. When the system fails continuously many times to produce reminders, the system will try to employ the exponent prediction to produce the fantastic reminder which often results in inspiration. The proposed method can be used to find the conditions leading to the inspiration so as to provide the means for the system to yield creative thinking. Now the proposed method has been integrated into the prototype system of creative design. The results of the experiment show its advantages in some aspects.

Title: Theory of measurement for voltage and affine variables

Abstract: This paper examines some of the properties of affine (interval, ratio and difference) measurement. Necessary and sufficient conditions for affine measurement and the implications of these conditions are studied. In particular, in the absence of an absolute zero or an absolute unit, ratio scales and pairwise comparisons cannot be utilized to construct affine scales and, as a result, Saaty's (1977) Analytic Hierarchy Process is invalidated. The measurement of variables such as voltage for which there are no models in the literature of measurement theory can be modeled within the framework constructed.

Title: An evolution model for the creative design

Abstract: In this paper an evolution model for creative design involving a mathematical model, evolution framework and implementation algorithms etc., is presented to effectively support the automation of creative design. The model takes the creative design process as an evolving process of a product prototype to the optimal scheme in accordance with a kind of measurement. This evolving process is built on the open genetic algorithm so as not to be confined by the initial population, which can get new individuals beyond the initial population by using creative reminding algorithms. At the same time, the model not only defines new operators based on the semantics of invention such as crossover, mutation, fitness function etc., but also provides an interface for integrating some other new methods of creative design as well as creative thinking patterns into the system. This model also supports a human-machine interface for receiving the guide from the design engineer online. Results of experiments with our implemented system, named AIE1.0, show that the model is promising.

Title: Cognitive artefacts for decision support

Abstract: We introduce a novel approach to computer-based modelling which allows the construction of cognitive artefacts with an unusual degree of openness and a potential for close integration with other artefacts and with human processes. Four particular artefacts concerning railway operation, timetabling, restaurant management and warehouse management are described briefly and attention is drawn to those properties concerning knowledge representation and communication which show that the modelling methods used have a significant contribution to make the development of more effective decision support systems in a business context.

Title: Automata for interaction protocols in multiagent systems

Abstract: Interaction among agents in multiagent systems may be tackled in various ways. The most common one though relies on the notion of a protocol the agents follow in order to structure the messages they exchange. In the literature however, one notices that the interpretation and representation of interaction protocols vary. We set a formal framework based on the theory of computing languages. After a quick introduction to some basic definitions of this theory applied to the domain of interaction protocols we develop the concepts of deterministic and nondeterministic protocols. We show that these two protocol classes are identical. Actually, although this property of nondeterminism introduces some true flexibility for protocol design it does not allow for an extension of this class. Then we focus on the definition of syntactically correct protocols and present grammars for generating authorized message sequences. We also show that the class of interaction protocols used in multiagent systems is the class of regular protocols. Finally we conclude with some limits and weaknesses of this class.

Title: A model for building planners that design

Abstract: Computer-aided process planning (CAPP) tools have the potential for assisting designers and manufacturing engineers in producing high-quality, low-cost products. AI planning research offers promising technologies for the development of such tools. However, current planning models limit the role that the planner can play in problem solving. Designers and manufacturers do more than simply generate process plans, they re-evaluate design decisions and design new tools to improve the manufacturability of a product. To assist in this effort, we need planners that understand the relationships between design and planning, and can suggest modifications to the part or to the tools used to create parts. To this end, we present a model for integrating planning and design. This model allows a planner to suggest changes to a problem description if it cannot solve the problem or to suggest new tools that will enable it to solve the problem in its original form. Thus, the model allows planners to take a more active role in the design process. We illustrate the use of this model by describing a system we have implemented which generates re-design suggestions to improve the manufacturability of machined parts.

Title: Generative user models for adaptive information retrieval

Abstract: For information retrieval (IR) tasks, user models are used to estimate user's true intention and demand. Unfortunately, most user models are constructed in a specialized form that is not applied to other systems or domains. This specialization makes it difficult to share user models as common resources for developing information retrieval systems and for researching cognitive characteristics in various users. In order to solve this problem, we need a general user modeling method. A user model based on a probabilistic framework is proposed. We call this model a generative user model. The generative user model represents user's mental depth by latent (hidden) variables. It also has visible variables that mean word set and qualifier of each word as a subjective probability distribution. The model can handle uncertainty of the user's subjectivity by a probabilistic framework. Recent statistical studies for such latent models give a learning algorithm. Our generative user model can be constructed from a dataset taken by information retrieval tasks. As an example, we also introduce two different kinds of information retrieval systems, ART MUSEUM (Multimedia Database with Sense of Color and Construction upon the Matter of ART) and DSIU (Decision Support for Internet Users). The generative user model is applied to these systems. The properties of the model and interactive learning mechanism are shown.

Title: As approach to transitional rules of emotional words based on the theory for subjective observation model

Abstract: This paper introduces the basic concepts of an artificial emotional processing system based on the theory of subjective observation model. We discuss the construction of transitional rules of emotional words and show how to construct the system by computer simulation. We discuss the transitional rules for emotional words. First, we show an image code dictionary of mixed emotional words. Secondly, the theory of subjective observation model as applied to the emotion processing system is briefly explained. Then, some attractive results obtained by the simulated emotion processing system are shown, namely what kind of emotions are observed by subjective observations, when a image code database is used for the input signal. Furthermore, we obtain several emotional transition rules processed by pair vectors such as [optimism, curiosity], which is very attractive result from a psychological viewpoint.

Title: The semantic network of KANSEI words

Abstract: We have developed a KANSEI (feeling or sensitivity in Japanese) dictionary system applicable to the semantic network by making use of the similarity of each word. This dictionary system can construct the numerical value of KANSEI words each of which is quite ambiguous. We introduce KANSEI words into our current information systems that manage subjective information. This dictionary handles more than 800 KANSEI words, the contents of which suffice for general purposes.

Title: A science and technology literacy browser

Abstract: An approach for a software tool, the Science and Technology Literacy Desktop, that can organize disparate online educational content into coherent lesson plans, automatically generate links to related reference material, and provide assessment of student comprehension is presented. Based on an enhanced Web browser concept it allows access to a wide variety of material and formats, yet provides the controls necessary for an instructor to administer effective lessons. This software takes a significant step beyond current educational software that lack extensibility to a range of information as broad as that found on the Internet.

Title: Querying and personalizing the Web: a multimedia personal assistant

Abstract: We suggest that four points should be considered when developing new information retrieval systems: a) taking information in its entirety (interpretation), b) managing multimedia information in an integrated way, c) reusing already available tools and d) tailoring information to single users. We propose a framework for endowing a software agent with the capacity to personalize itself to its users through interaction, and to perform tasks that involve subjective factors. We describe K-DIME, a software prototype that can retrieve material from the Web based on both objective and subjective features of content. Being capable of bootstrapping a new user model from a model of a user with similar profile, K-DIME significantly reduces the workload generally associated with the online learning phase. Through continuous adaptation driven by specific patterns of interaction with the user, K-DIME can cope with the intrinsic variability of subjective impressions. We discuss K-DIME's performance in a scenario in which users retrieve pictures for greeting cards according to a given subjective impression that they wish to convey.

Title: Evaluation of edge detection methods through psychological tests-is the detected edge really desirable for humans?

Abstract: We propose a method to quantitatively evaluate image processing methods on how well they simulate human visual processing through psychological and statistical tests. First, we focus on edge detection, an image processing technique. To set all edge detection methods fairly, we collect the edge data detected by humans. Then, the signal processing parameters for each edge detection method are adjusted with the same optimizing method based on minimizing the error between the edges detected by the detector and by humans. Two psychological experiments are conducted, confirming whether the edge detection parameters are optimized and evaluating the performance of edge detection methods. The results indicate that the optimizing method functioned comparatively well. The effectiveness rank of edge detection methods is also obtained.

Title: TeamStorms as a theory of instruction

Abstract: TeamStorms is a team-centered, problem-solving based approach to instruction, stressing active participation on the part of students in a constructivist learning environment. Not all students readily think in the abstract; however, this is not to say that they cannot. TeamStorms, combined with the LEGO/sup (R)/ Mindstorms/sup TM/ Robotics Invention System/sup TM/, attempts to provide a learning environment where the abstract world of computer science can be made real and concrete to students, teaching them knowledge and process skills that are foundational to the discipline.

Title: The Micro-Rato contest: a popular approach to improve self-study in electronics and computer science

Abstract: Robotic competitions for students have been around for more than two decades. Although the benefits of these competitions can be exploited at various levels of education, recent examples have been following a trend towards higher complexity. In order to bring the pedagogical advantages of robotics competitions down to a level where they can be exploited by undergraduate and high school students, a somewhat different strategy is presented in this paper. Since 1995, the authors have been organising the Micro-Rato Contest of the University of Aveiro, a competition of small autonomous and mobile robots. This paper provides an overview of the contest, describing the strategy followed by the organisers, the rules and technical specifications, as well as a brief profile of some of the robots.

Title: Libre software environment for robot programming

Abstract: When facing the problem of teaching the basis of robot control programming to computer science students, apart from the syllabus of the course, some other requirements have to be considered, such as which is the most appropriate robot and which are the right tools for learning how to control it. In this paper, we describe the tools we have chosen for teaching robotics, focusing on an environment that supports practical assignments. We also analyze the reasons that made us choose each tool, giving special emphasis to the Libre software requirement that we have imposed on every tool we are using. Finally, we present the results and opinions we have obtained from our students and the lessons we have learned by using this Libre software approach.

Title: Use of the walking machine Flat Freddy in computer science education

Abstract: This paper is a case study addressing a walking machine, named Flat Freddy, which was designed and built for practical work within computer science studies. The regular aim of the annual practical course "Electronics and Microsystem Technology" is to design an electronic circuit, normally a piece of digital hardware. Another rationale behind it is to broaden the students' view of systems design. In 1999, we decided to use a walking machine as the target application platform in order to emphasise the need for an interdisciplinary system design and the control aspects of dynamic systems in general. Another aim was to cover as many levels of a (mobile) robotic system as possible, with the emphasis on electronics. In this paper, the walking machine itself and the specific task of the practical work are briefly described. Then the results are presented and the experiences gained from them are discussed.

Title: Autonomous robotics projects for learning software engineering

Abstract: Software engineering consists of a body of theory and a collection of techniques for designing useful software-based products while minimizing both the development risk and the risk of in-service product failure. Systems engineering and project management techniques are key components of this discipline. While these techniques can be presented in a didactic manner, students generally learn better when "hands-on" experiences are combined with theoretical exposition. Autonomous robotics projects can provide an opportunity for these hands-on experiences. This paper describes a one-semester software engineering course in which student teams successfully undertook robotic development projects with significant uncertainty. These projects provided significant intrinsic motivation and extrinsic measures of success for the student development teams.

Title: An infrastructure for flexible, modular, multi-user intelligent interfaces

Abstract: Multi-user interfaces are generally held to be difficult to write. However, several groups have shown that a good multi-user infrastructure or a toolkit can make the programmer burden more tractable. This paper expands on the theme and describes an infrastructure that supports not only multi-user interfaces but also their interaction with other (non-interface) agents. The idea is to support agent collaboration and to consider an interface to be just another type of agent.

Title: ePro: a system for supporting collaboration that enhances interactions

Abstract: Many systems that support group activities utilize computer and network technologies so that people in different places or at different times can communicate with each other. In this paper, we propose a system called ePro for supporting face-to-face collaboration by integrating physical and virtual worlds. In order to enhance interactions among group members and raise their engagement, ePro connects a sensor-embedded board and a computer simulation. In our current implementation, ePro is used to discuss urban planning and environmental problems. Group members collaboratively construct a town by placing a piece, such as a house, on a sensor-embedded board (physical world). The computer simulation program automatically recognizes the arrangement of pieces on the board. It then visualizes environmental changes to the town on the board through simulations (virtual world). The visualization shown to the group members amplifies the interaction among them and gives them feedback for re-designing the town on the board. In order to evaluate the effects of supporting group activities by combining physical and virtual worlds, preliminary experiments with ePro were carried out.

Title: Measuring the effects of interruptions on task performance in the user interface

Abstract: As users continue offloading more control and responsibility to the computer, coordinating the asynchronous interactions between the user and computer is becoming increasingly important. Without proper coordination, an application attempting to gain the user's attention risks interrupting the user in the midst of performing another task. To justify why an application should avoid interrupting the user whenever possible, we designed an experiment measuring the disruptive effect of an interruption on a user's task performance. The experiment utilized six Web-based task categories and two categories of interruption tasks. The results of the experiment demonstrate that: (i) a user performs slower on an interrupted task than a non-interrupted task, (ii) the disruptive effect of an interruption differs as a function of the task category, and (iii) different interruption tasks cause similar disruptive effects on task performance. These results empirically validate the need to better coordinate user interactions among applications that are competing for the user's attention.

Title: MIDAS: MIC Interactive DAnce System

Abstract: We have been studying how to establish a method for extracting human emotion in order to express emotional images by utilizing multimedia, such as video and sound. Human body motion is the most basic essence in expressing human emotion. MIDAS (MIC Interactive DAnce System) is an application of the emotional information extracting/expressing method in a dance system. In this system, we applied R. Laban's (1879-1958) dance theory to extract physical characteristics of dance motion from real-time video sequences, and we mapped this information to categories of emotional image expression. In this way, we can relate the motion to an emotional representation using multimedia.

Title: Analysis of interaction in musical communication and its modeling

Abstract: Listening to music at a live performance is different from listening to music from passive media (e.g. a CD), and a live performance gives a better impression. This is caused not only by the sound facilities but also by interaction between the player and the listener. In this research, in order to analyze such interactions in music communication, the relation between the listener's respiration and the music was investigated. As a result, forced entrainment was discovered between the period of a musical bar and the period of the listener's respiration in listening to music from passive media, and mutual entrainment was discovered between these periods in listening to music from a live performance. Based on our measurement results, a communication model was constructed with a mutual entrainment model and an experiment was performed. The result was that most of the subjects felt that its music was live.

Title: Analysis of the process of mutual interaction between human and internal control model

Abstract: Clarifies the effectiveness of the 'internal control model', which we have suggested as a model of flexible human communication. This is the technology to which we apply the phenomenon known as 'entrainment of bodily rhythm' and the dynamics realized by this phenomenon. Concretely, we take the 'walking support robot' as an example of its application, and analyze the process of realizing cooperative walking between a human and the robot. In particular, we discuss whether or not the dynamics on the human side is the same as the robot's dynamics and whether or not these dynamics can be synchronized with the dynamics on the model side if the process exists on the human side. From the results, it is clarified whether or not the internal control model is able to realize flexible and cooperative behavior with a human.

Title: Real-time rendering of artificial guidance

Abstract: Virtual assembly computer tools assist human operators in their work of mechanical assembly inside virtual environments. This paper investigates the real-time rendering of computer-synthesized guidance. It uses a biologically inspired neural network to generate collision-free paths, and helps users to specify assembly tasks by guiding the motion of objects. This work leverages the power of "manufacturing in the computer" with the creation of artificial guidance that could be unavailable in the physical world.

Title: Modeling of spoken dialogue control for improvement of dialogue efficiency

Abstract: In this research, we aim at the establishment of a method of controlling dialogues in accordance with the changes of performance in computation. So that the system takes the most suitable dialogue strategy according to performance in computation, it needs to calculate evaluation functions modeled with performance in computation in the inside all the time. In this paper, we model dialogue control centered on system transparency with computation time and accuracy of system's processes. Then, we simulate this model by controlling dialogue strategies. We also confirm the effectiveness of the model by a preliminary experiment using the prototype of a spoken dialogue system.

Title: An audio-video front-end for multimedia applications

Abstract: Applications such as video gaming, virtual reality, multimodal user interfaces and videoconferencing, require systems that can locate and track persons in a room through a combination of visual and audio cues, enhance the sound that they produce, and perform identification. We describe the development of a particular multimodal sensor fusion system that is portable, runs in real time and achieves these objectives. The system employs novel algorithms for acoustical source location, video-based person tracking and overall system control, which are also described.

Title: Emotion in user interface, voice interaction system

Abstract: An approach towards a personalized voice-emotion user interface regardless of the speaker's age, sex or language is presented. An extensive set of carefully chosen utterances provided a speech database for investing acoustic similarities among eight emotional states: (unemotional) neutral, anger, sadness, happiness, disgust, surprised, stressed/troubled and scared. Based on those results, a voice interaction system (VIS) capable of sensing the user's emotional message was developed. In efforts to detect emotions, several primary parameters from human speech were analyzed: pitch, formants, tempo (rhythm) and power of human voice. First the individual basic speaker's voice characteristics were extracted (pitch or/and formants in neutral speech, normal speech rate, neutral speech power) and based on those parameters the emotional message of the subject's utterance was successfully extracted. The VIS interacts with the user while changing its response according to the user's utterances.

Title: Synchronization validation mechanism in multimedia document presentation

Abstract: Synchronization is the major processing task during multimedia presentation, which defines the time relation between multimedia objects. There are many synchronization specification methods, and each has different advantages and disadvantages. Those methods work well for the simple and specific synchronization case, but when considering large complex multimedia presentation, there lacks an effective method to deal with the complex time relation. In this paper, a synchronization point based specification method (SPM) is proposed, and based on it, a static and dynamic validation mechanism for the synchronization relation is given. In SPM, the synchronization relation is defined in synchronization points (SP). Multimedia presentation control is based on SP's status during presentation. According to the order of SPs, SPM gives the static and dynamic validation algorithm, which can avoid the conflict relation between SPs. SPM gives a way to define the nondetermined synchronization relation between multimedia objects, and proposes static and dynamic validation mechanisms for complex synchronization control. This synchronization point based mechanism can extend the capability of synchronization definition and control in a multimedia system.

Title: Face-to-face interaction with an electronic personal sales assistant

Abstract: The research presented explores a new paradigm for e-commerce human-computer-interaction, presentation and personalisation. It describes face-to-face conversational interaction with intelligent, visual, lifelike electronic sales assistant agents. This paradigm joins two research areas: that of visual and conversational interface agents which provide an intuitive metaphor for human-computer interaction based on face-to-face conversation; and that of knowledge-based, market-aware, user-aware personal agents that can adapt to individual consumer preferences and requirements in a service-based electronic market. By combining these two areas we yield a conversational form of human-machine interaction that has potential for shaping tomorrow's interface to the world of e-commerce.

Title: Image Wave: rhythmic synchronization of multimedia components

Abstract: The characteristics of a multimedia content structure based on its temporal parallelism are typically found in counterpoint musical pieces. These characteristics act as a rhythmic synchronization mechanism that forms a temporal image of the multimedia content. In our Multimedia Montage study, we have developed a prototype system that produces a movie according to the script description of the component structure. We applied this system to the counterpoint structure and produced movies that we call counterpoint movies. In order to automate the rhythmic synchronization of the multimedia components, we started a new study called Image Wave. In this study, we are engaged in the rhythmic information extraction of multimedia components and their composition based on the rhythmic information.

Title: 3-D drawing system via hand motion recognition from two cameras

Abstract: The authors propose a novel human interface system, 3-D Drawing System, which allows a user to draw on virtual 3D space in a computer with a user's hand motions and hand poses. The system has two cameras; one camera takes a top-view of the desktop and another takes a side-view. The input image of the top camera is transformed into the distance-transformed image, which is used for deciding Palm Square that gives the base size, position, and direction of hand. The Palm Square determines Finger Windows which are used for detecting each finger's expansion that is decided by the number of pixels in the Finger Window. The user's command is input to the system by the finger's expansion. At the same time, we extract the fingertip and estimate the 3D position by comparison with the image obtained with the side camera. The procedures are very simple so we can develop the real time 3D drawing system, which allows the user to draw figures in 3D space, and handle 3D virtual objects.

Title: A Web-based technical assistance center

Abstract: The Web-based technical assistance center presented in this paper offers an efficient solution to ensure a consistently high level of technical service to the end-users or customers, thereby increasing the productivity of support center staff. The Web-based technical assistance center tracks and manages technical service calls. It allows users to enter and track the status of service requests at their own workstation. Requests are categorized based on the application systems and the type of fixes, for more useful reporting. For convenience and efficiency, the service displays automatically any known information, and prompts lists of predefined values in appropriate boxes, for quick selection. For each application, the system administrator can set up an escalation path and a required response time for each level of support.

Title: Study on intelligent autonomous navigation of avatar using hand gesture recognition

Abstract: The authors present a real time hand gesture recognition system that controls the motion of a human avatar based on predefined dynamic hand gestures in a virtual environment. First, we note that recognition of a distinction between the start and end of a motion is needed and a lot of time is spent on learning in conventional recognition systems. To resolve this problem, we propose a recognition method using intelligent techniques. Then, we also present an obstacle-free path generation method to ensure that an avatar can navigate, avoiding obstacles in a virtual environment.

Title: Annotation and indexing in the video management system VOM

Abstract: This paper presents mechanisms for annotating and indexing video by keywords in the Video Object Management system, called VOM. In order to annotate video, an entire video is divided into its video clips, and keywords are assigned to them. These clips are represented in objects, and the objects are organized into a hierarchical data structure in sense of their playback order. Moreover, such objects include a collection of keywords for specifying each object. Then, one object is defined to concatenate several short clips. Keywords assigned to lower positioned objects are abstracted in proportion as this concatenation. The keywords of higher positioned objects are chosen from a collection of the keywords that are assigned into lower ones, or are associated from a set of existing keywords. VOM provides a mechanism to assist in keyword abstraction based on classification of keywords and objects. A collection of them is classified by latent semantic indexing. In addition, the classes consisting of the objects and their keywords are reflected the playback order of the objects.

Title: A speech driven embodied interaction robots system for human communication support

Abstract: The concept of a speech driven embodied interaction robots system is introduced for supporting human interaction by generating the expressive actions or motions of robots coherently related to speech input. The prototype of the system which consists of 2 interaction robots called InterRobots with both functions of speaker and listener is developed in which two models are incorporated: one is a listener's action model where nodding, blinking and the motions of head, arms and body are estimated by the hierarchical MA (moving-average) model of the burst-pause (ON-OFF) of speech to the nodding; the other is a speaker's action model in which the motions of head, arms and body are estimated by its own MA model of the ON-OFF of speech to the head motion. By sensory evaluation and behavioral analysis in human-robot interaction, the effectiveness of InterRobot's interaction is demonstrated. The effectiveness of the embodied interaction robot system is also confirmed in remote communication.

Title: A conversational robot utilizing facial and body expressions

Abstract: Communication using non-verbal expression, such as gesture, eyeshot, posture and facial expression, plays an important role in human interaction. For example, in conveying spatial information of the position and/or size of an object, pointing actions also contribute to simplifying the verbal expressions. By nodding or changing facial expressions toward the speaker's utterance, humans convey their state of mind to the speaker and realize a conversable environment. No current conversational systems are equipped with such adequate communicational ability. The authors implement body and facial expressions and conversational function in a humanoid robot and try to realize a natural conversational system. As a result, effective use of the pointing action with verbal expressions "that one" or "this one" contribute to simplifying the verbal expression and realization of rhythmical conversation. In addition, proper feedback actions to the user with facial expressions improve the transparency of the system and the performance of the interface.

Title: Modeling of agent's behavior in human-robot interaction using model integrated computing

Abstract: Due to a continuous increase in the need to provide more services to health care through robotic aid systems developed for the disabled, the need for addressing human-robot interaction (HRI) has gained the utmost importance. HRI is based on a multi-agent architecture, the Intelligent Machine Architecture (IMA) (R.A. Peters II et al., 1999; W.A. Alford et al., 1999), a new approach for software design for intelligent machines that are principally limited by difficulty in integrating existing algorithms, models, and subsystems. A system of interactive software agents, designed within IMA, encapsulates the various hardware elements, environmental elements, behaviors and tasks. IMA suggests "a society of agents" (M. Minsky, 1985) paradigm to create complex high-level functionality from any sublevels of components. The high-level agents currently employ finite state machines to sequence the activation and suppression of behavior agents. A state machine is realized by two components: state machine engine and state machine representation. Model Integrated Computing (MIC) (G. Nordstrom et al., 1998) is used to model the behavior of the IMA agents. The paper presents a toolkit that designs the agent's behavior through a state-transition metamodeling environment and builds the agent with the help of an existing Agent Builder application.

Title: The human agent: a work in progress toward human-humanoid interaction

Abstract: At the Intelligent Robotics Laboratory of the Center for Intelligent Systems at Vanderbilt University, we have been developing a humanoid system called ISAC, (Intelligent Soft-Arm Control), over the past several years. As people work with a humanoid system, the interaction should be natural and robust. Our framework for human-humanoid interaction (HHI) considers various aspects of HHI and the paper presents information about the development of one key element of this system: the human agent.

Title: Naturalistic human-robot collaboration based upon mixed-initiative interactions in teleoperating environment

Abstract: The paper presents a method for the design of a robot teleoperation system based upon mixed-initiative interactions to realize the naturalistic collaboration between a human operator and a mobile robot with its autonomy. First, we analyze a robot-teleoperating environment and classify its parameters into the four different classes of information after A. Kirlik's (1998) Generalized Lens Model framework: whether the operator and/or the robot can directly perceive the information or not, and whether they can directly manipulate the information or not. Based on this analysis, we develop an ecological interface system adopting a force-feedback joystick as a device providing a shared modality between a human operator and a robot's autonomy.

Title: Human tracking based on attention distraction

Abstract: The face tracker system of a humanoid, ISAC (Intelligent Soft Arm Control), is integrated with two modalities for localizing humans in order to direct ISAC's attention and to prevent ISAC from being quickly distracted. The sound source localization and passive infrared (PIR) motion detection systems are used to provide the face tracker system with candidate regions for finding a face. However, the sensing modules should not directly gain control of the tracking if the system has recently acquired a new face. Our goal is to allow a human to redirect the attention of the system, but give the system a method to ignore the distraction if recently engaged.

Title: Towards socially acceptable robots

Abstract: Robots are integrating more and more into our lives, However, to become an integral part of daily life, they should be socially accepted by humans. Evidently, the acceptance rate will increase as human-robot interaction gets closer to human-human interaction. The article describes the development of a Web based information filtering system, which enables a humanoid robot to initiate interaction with a human by generating human-like daily conversations.

Title: A man-machine interface for camera control in remote monitoring using line-of-sight

Abstract: In this information oriented society, the man-machine interface is a necessary technology, and comfortable operation for the user is desired. The authors are developing a man-machine interface employing the user's line of sight (LOS). With this novel interface, the user can control the aspect of the multifunction monitoring camera using only his LOS. The LOS is calculated using image processing. The image from the monitoring camera is projected on the monitor, and the user's LOS is shown as the cursor on the same monitor. We defined three LOS parameters for use in the interface: fixed gaze, shifting LOS, and disinterest. The study demonstrates the feasibility of one function of a man-machine interface using LOS. This interface can be used for monitoring shops and warehouses, or in remote conferencing systems.

Title: An analysis of the amplitude factors of the Bunraku puppet's motion axis-for the description, analysis, and generation of humanoids' motions

Abstract: In order to design emotional actions of computer graphic characters, the authors analysed the actions of a Bunraku puppet which is manipulated by an expert of puppet manipulation. The puppet's action is decomposed into a main part which is the motion of the puppet's axis and the accompaniment which is the relative motion with respect to the motion of the axis. The emotional actions of the puppet are explained by the phase factor and the amplitude factor of the motion of the puppet's axis. Based on this analysis, a simple method to design emotional actions are obtained.

Title: Magical device: a small device that makes it easy to build real-world navigation systems

Abstract: Recently, much attention has been paid to research on real-world navigation systems. Although some real-world navigation systems have already been implemented, they have not been widely adopted, because they assume the use of a computer network system and are difficult to use for both providers and users. To solve this problem, we propose a small magical device based on an existing device called a PHS (Personal Handy-phone System). If providers and users use magical devices, they can use the real-world navigation systems easily and at low cost.

Title: Cognitive man-machine-cooperation: modeling operators' general objectives and its role within a cockpit assistant system

Abstract: Modern cockpit environments, covering highly integrated and complex automatic functions, pose various demands on the crew. Aircraft manufacturers and flying organizations try to alleviate crew decision-making as much as possible. This is done by means of automation and by establishing standard procedures and checklists to cover anticipated failures or emergencies. So far, automation often leads to clumsiness, which is considered to be a major reason for severe deficiencies concerning the interaction between cockpit crew and aircraft systems. Cognitive systems appear to be a promising approach to overcome these deficiencies in future cockpits. They cover the capabilities for situation interpretation, planning and decision making as well as autonomous execution of a plan. Cognitive assistant systems are designed to make use of these capabilities in favor of a cooperative approach. The cognitive process and its cognitive components are introduced. The cooperation between man and cognitive assistant system poses new demands. An explicit 'mental model' is a fundamental requirement for the assistant system. Analysis, behavior, design and the role of explicit 'mental models' within a cognitive cockpit assistant system are described.

Title: Experiments on operator matching in visual teleoperation

Abstract: Visual feedback is an essential part of any telerobotic system. Traditional approaches have provided the operator with a view of the remote workcell either through TV monitors fed by cameras dotted around the workcell or by direct viewing. More recently, virtual viewing systems have been used for operator feedback because they allow the operator a choice of viewpoint. Care, however, must be taken to ensure that objects displayed by the virtual view are in true relation to their remote workcell counterparts. In this paper, the effects of two types of errors on operator performance are reported. The first type of error is due to offsets (biases) of the virtual object from their true workcell locations which are caused by modelling errors of the remote workcell. The second is caused by noise and dynamics induced by the sensors and filters used to track the position and orientation (pose) of the remote objects. Experiments are conducted to examine the performance of operators completing peg-in-hole tasks subject to the two errors. We conclude the paper by commenting on the validity of current operator motor control models.

Title: Map building with ultrasonic sensors of indoor environments using neural networks

Abstract: Map building and position estimation are basic tasks in mobile robot navigation with path planning. A method to generate a global map of the vehicle work environment using ultrasonic sensors is developed in this paper. Depending on the physical properties of the walls that form the room where the robot is navigating, sonar sensors show different behaviours. A neural network is utilized to interpret the range readings of ultrasonic sensors in the different environments. A local map composed of squared cells is formed through the neural network that gives the occupancy probabilities for each cell. Finally, a global map is built achieving integration of different views of the environment using Bayes' rule. Results of the method implementation in the construction in a specular environment as well as in rough wall environments are shown in this paper.

Title: A prototype adaptive finger-pointing interface for operating secondary controls in motor vehicles

Abstract: Analysis has shown that a proportion of motor vehicle accidents are caused by driver inattention induced by the operation of secondary controls, e.g. radio and climate controls. We have developed a novel, prototype, finger-pointing interface for operating such controls. The current physical controls are replaced by a computer interface, which has the advantage of being situated much closer to the driver's normal line of sight. This interface is operated by the driver using pointing gestures that will ultimately be identified using computer vision. The potential safety benefits that may accrue from this interface are outlined. The prototype interface currently uses an electromagnetic sensor to determine the direction of the pointing gesture. This paper describes this prototype and reports preliminary results from use of the graphical user interface.

Title: Seeing by drawing: use of a force-feedback device for conveying basic geometric visual information

Abstract: In this paper, the problem of using a force-feedback device to display basic geometric information is considered. Two visual-haptic transformation methods are applied to display geometric-shape properties by a point-contact force-reflective device. With the first method, movement of a user's finger tip, attached to a force-feedback device's thimble, is limited to points on a contour representing an outline of the (1-D or 2-D) geometric shape under display. In the second method, a drawing force is applied to a thimble, to move a user's finger along the contour corresponding to the displayed shape. Drawing speed is adjusted to reflect some properties of the displayed data curve, such as evolution of its first or second derivatives over time or spatial reference axis. Implementation aspects of the two methods are discussed. Efficiency of the described haptic display methods has been investigated through experiments with basic geometric outline shapes and scientific data.

Title: Teaching of assembly motion by demonstration-artificial constrained motion primitives and its implementation using virtual polyhedron

Abstract: Teaching by demonstration is a method to generate a robot program that makes a robot do the same task as the task which a human operator demonstrates. The author developed a teaching by demonstration in VR system which automatically generates a robot program to work in the real world after a task is demonstrated by an operator in the virtual world. This system deals with a task of controlling contact states between bodies like the assembly task. When one body is not in contact with another, not only contact states but also other new states which can specify more general arrangement of the bodies are necessary in order to make the robot more skilful. The author introduced a virtual smallface (VSF) and an artificial constrained motion primitive (ACMP) for this purpose. A virtual polyhedron for constrained motion (VPCM) is newly introduced in order to implement more general ACMPs. An operator more easily and generally defines new states of the task by using VSFs and VPCMs, since VSFs are used to define intuitively new states of a task and since (virtual) contact states between VPCMs are also used as the new states.

Title: Effects of duration of immersion in a virtual environment on postural stability

Abstract: A few studies have been carried out to examine the relationship between postural stability and subjective reports (feelings) of motion sickness. Two views seem to exist on the relationship between immersion in a VR environment and subjective feeling of motion sickness. One predicts that the immersion induces both postural instability and motion sickness. Another view is that pre-immersion postural instability predispose us to motion sickness. However, these views are not successfully supported by empirical researches. Longer immersions in a VR environment may induce higher levels of postural instability and symptoms of motion sickness. Effects of long-hours immersion in a virtual environment on postural stability were examined using a force platform measurement and conducting a self-reported questionnaire on motion sickness.

Title: System status evaluation: monitoring the state of agents in a humanoid system

Abstract: In order for a humanoid robot to be accepted in society and perform as an intelligent human assistant or companion, it must exhibit robust human-humanoid interaction (HHI). Additionally, the humanoid must be able to recognize if it is working properly, and if not, why. We describe our development of a framework for HHI. This framework includes a high-level agent called the Self Agent; part of its role is to maintain information about the status of the humanoid. To accomplish this, we have developed a technique called system status evaluation that the humanoid uses to detect and localize failures. We present the results of the use of SSE on a humanoid system called ISAC.

Title: Design of a virtual laboratory for teaching electric machinery

Abstract: Significant progress has been made in distance learning with the result that network learning services are more complicated than ever. One new trend is using computer-assisted techniques for the teaching of experiments. By using these methods, safety concerns are reduced, as are operation and instrument costs. A virtual environment has reality and interaction performance. A distributed virtual environment also means that multiple users can join in the same session. We determine the construction, movement and curriculum of virtual environments in the teaching of electric machinery experiments. We set up a virtual laboratory with reality, interaction and flexibility. In the laboratory, human-computer interaction and human-human interaction are provided for teachers and students.

Title: Development of a networked and sensorized environment

Abstract: The authors describes a concept and an implementation of a networked and sensorized environment which they are developing. They call this environment SELF, named after Sensorized Environment for Life. The main objective of SELF is to construct an environment which can support healthcare of not only aged but healthy people with the information accumulated by surrounding sensors installed in it. To equip such capabilities with the system, all sensors should be embedded in the environment and systematically form a sensor network. This paper outlines the concept of SELF and shows its current implementations.

Title: The hand force feedback: analysis and control of a haptic device for the human-hand

Abstract: The hand force feedback system is an anthropomorphic haptic interface for the replication of the forces arising during grasping and fine manipulation operations. It is composed of four independent finger dorsal exoskeletons which wrap up four fingers of the human hand (the little finger is excluded). Each finger possesses three electrically actuated DOF placed in correspondence with the human finger flexion axes and a passive DOF allowing finger abduction movements. Each exoskeleton finger has three points of attachment to the operator's finger (two for the thumb) at the middle of the phalanges. Mechanical fixtures guarantee that just a force perpendicular to the finger and in its sagittal plane is exchanged at each point of attachment. Such force component is sensed and it is actively controlled in feedback. The paper illustrates the design and testing of the controller for the thumb exoskeleton. First the mechanical system is analyzed and the features which influence the controller design, such as the presence of unidirectional tendon transmission, are modeled. Then haptic controllers, i.e. feedback controllers aiming at improving the performance of the device when used as a haptic interface for virtual environments or telemanipulation, are designed and tested experimentally. Finally the experimental results are discussed.

Title: Attentive camera navigation in virtual environments

Abstract: Gaining an accurate mental representation of real environments and realistic virtual environments is a gradual process. Significant aspects of an environment may be obvious to a trained expert, but not to the novice trainee. If a user does not know where to look, he or she may concentrate on irrelevant objects. This detracts from learning the locations of truly prominent landmarks. The paper explores attentive camera navigation, a technique that guides the user to focus on certain objects through automatic gaze redirection. Results of a user study suggest that this technique can help filter out unnecessary objects, and allow users to quickly understand the configuration of a selected subset of landmarks.

Title: An interactive CG system based an virtual sculpting and virtual woodblock printing

Abstract: We present an interactive computer graphic design system based on virtual sculpting to create three-dimensional (3D) solid objects and virtual woodblock printing to synthesize 2D images, with the stress on the aspect of a tool to enjoy creation or manipulation of 3D shapes. In the virtual sculpting system, a user can form a solid object as if carving a workpiece with chisels. A 3D object generated by the system looks like a real wooden sculpture. If using a board as a workpiece, a user can generate a virtual printing woodblock. A user can synthesize a woodblock print from the woodblock mentioned, a virtual paper sheet, ink, and a printing brush in a virtual space. In this system, the operations of sculpting and printing are similar to the real ones, and still even children can experience creation of complete computer graphics.

Title: Washout filter design for a motorcycle simulator

Abstract: Many motion based simulators have been developed for many different types of vehicles. In order to make a simulation more realistic, linear accelerations and angular rates are exerted on the pilot by moving the platform on which the mock-up vehicle is located. This has to be accomplished without driving the simulator out of its work-space. The software component that is in charge of this is commonly referred to as the washout filter. Washout filters have been widely investigated in the past, mainly in the field of flight simulators. We present a washout filter designed for a motorcycle simulator. The solution is preliminary and follows, as a reference point, techniques previously adopted for large aircraft simulators. Differences between motorcycle and aircraft simulation are analyzed and a preliminary customized solution is proposed. The washout filter, which will be used to drive a motorcycle simulator, currently being built at PERCRO, has been tested off-line showing good results and will soon be tested on real riders.

Our main goal in the LI2 laboratory is to make interactive and co-operative prototyping for well defined systems. Users and software agents evolving in our virtual worlds can interact, communicate and modify their behavior. The article focuses on the way our agents communicate in a "natural language" by exchanging information and knowledge. For this purpose we have developed a communication language based on "speech acts theory" and on agent communication languages (ACL). The Knowledge Query Manipulation Language (KQML) is the ACL we have chosen to develop high level communication among "intelligent agents". To validate our developments and thus the KQML specifications, we have tested them in a contract net application. Contract net applications use communication mechanisms based on offers, bids, contracts and so on, which can be designed by KQML message exchanges.

Title: A multiagent architecture for distributed virtual environments

Abstract: This paper introduces a distributed virtual reality platform based on oRis, our dynamic and interpreted multiagent language. This platform, called AReViDis, has been designed for collaborative interactive prototyping. Thanks to the dynamic properties of oRis, we propose to let the designers of a system enter inside the system and dynamically build and modify the model. During an AReViDis session, this language allows the addition or the modification of virtual agents in a distributed virtual environment. These modifications may either be introduced by the agents themselves or by the users through various human computer interfaces. These modifications may also be received by the network allowing communications in shared virtual worlds.

Title: A development of simple haptic display

Abstract: Force and tactile feedback greatly enhance the interaction of virtual environment applications. A simple haptics display that has a very high frequency response of the force feedback was developed. The simple haptics display presents force feedback and also vibrotactile information. In the design overview, we propose the categorization of the object presentation data and the data format. We calculated some of these patterns, including tactile and temperature data. The frequency response of the haptics display was examined. The experiments of vibrotactile presentation in contact with wood and aluminum were presented, and a method of the surface roughness presentation were also investigated. Results showed that the simple haptics display provides a sufficient frequency response for presenting vibrotactile information at contact and perceiving a surface roughness of virtual objects.

Title: The use of class graph to analyze the effectiveness of an approach for object-oriented class-level testing

Abstract: In order to improve reliability and quality, software systems should be tested. The testing of object-oriented software systems is more complex than that of traditional programming. Recently, we have proposed an approach to select a finite number of representative equivalent pairs as test cases from the infinite set of all equivalent pairs. The approach is based on the concept of equivalent fundamental pairs. We analyze the effectiveness of this approach using a class graph. A class graph can be derived from the syntax declaration of the algebraic specification for the given class under test. Using the class graph, we show that our approach omits many testing paths in the class graph but doesn't reduce the testing effect. Hence, the testing efficiency is improved greatly.

Title: A dynamic approach for object-oriented cluster-level tests by program instrumentation

Abstract: A static approach of cluster-level testing for object oriented software systems has been proposed previously. The present paper presents a dynamic approach for cluster-level testing. The approach is based on contract specification for message passing across different classes in the given cluster. The program instrumentation technique is used in this dynamic approach. A prototype of a semi-automatic CASE tool supporting this approach has been developed.

Title: Comparison of matching criteria for the interposition problem in augmented reality

Abstract: The article discusses the interposition problem in augmented reality-that is, the realistic and physically-consistent embedding of a 3D virtual object (3DVO) into a real scene. Our method deals with stereoscopic views of an unstructured and unknown real scene and avoids explicit 3D reconstruction. Instead, we consider a 3DVO as a set of vertices and rely on local stereo matching to decide whether each vertex should be visible or not. We focus on the choice of an optimal matching criterion in the particular context of interposition in augmented reality. After a brief presentation of our innovative solution, we review classical matching spaces and criteria, and select the most appropriate for our task. We compare and interpret their performance against parameters such as noise level and matching window size and present preliminary results of interposition for real scenes.

Title: Revised design calculations of elevator systems

Abstract: For sufficient carrying capacity and passenger comfort and convenience, it is very important to design suitable elevator systems (e.g., the appropriate number of cages, velocity, capacity, etc.) using models that describe real elevator movements. The procedure used in conventional design calculations for office buildings is to determine the carrying capacity for peak traffic situations using simple passenger arrival models. The paper presents new revised design calculations using the balanced traffic model, which can deal with elevator movements considering the passenger arrival rate. As some performance indices to evaluate the quality of service can be calculated using this model, elevator system designers can now determine appropriate elevator facilities satisfying goals. The validity of the proposed model is also shown by comparison with measured data for real elevator systems.

Title: Two approaches to generate non-equivalent ground terms as test cases for object-oriented software

Abstract: Software testing is an important technique for improving the reliability and quality of software systems. Object-oriented programming is considered to be the most promising programming methodology. We propose two approaches to generate non-equivalent ground terms as test cases. These approaches are based on the technique of fundamental equivalent pair. The basic idea of these approaches is as follows. Suppose u/sub 1//spl sim/u/sub 2/ is a fundamental equivalent pair, u/sub 2/* is the normal form of u/sub 2/. Suppose further that by changing the values of parameters of constructor contained in u/sub 2/*, or by inserting a basic constructor into u/sub 2/*, we obtain another ground term u/sub 2/', then u/sub 1/ and u/sub 2/' are nonequivalent, and can be used as a test case.

Title: CLINT: a prototype logistics collaboratory

Abstract: The paper discusses the domain of Army logistics planning at the level of the ODSCLOG (Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Logistics) and describes tools to assist in this planning. In particular, we have developed a prototype collaboratory (CLINT) for logistics planning that relies on Microsoft NetMeeting/sup TM/ as the collaborative infrastructure, and a tool named THREADS to support logistics problem solving. THREADS is a "visual simulation" of logistics routes that allows planners to quickly identify bottlenecks and compare alternative plans.

Title: A process for improving multi-technology system high level design: modeling, verification and validation of complex optronic systems

Abstract: In order to support the design of complex systems such as optronic systems, and especially the function-processing oriented part of this work, we propose a method based on a connection of stages. This is aimed at making the representation of the system and its properties both formal and checkable. These formalizations can be used to manage the real verification of the system and determine the agreement between its model and the expected properties. The principle is to follow the first steps (corresponding to the design phase) of the traditional V-cycle of system development, and to enrich each step with formal features: the first step is the elaboration, based on initial requirements, of a function processing oriented specification. The first result is then a formalized (functional and non-functional) requirements set. It allows the system designer to construct, using the generic model and properties inventory, the precise model of the system (i.e. an instantiated model, called MOTI), and the list of properties to be verified. This MOTI is then (automatically) translated into a so-called MOTIF expressed in a formalism dedicated to formal proof (required for formal verification and validation processes). Concurrently, the expected properties (which have been extracted from the generic properties inventory enriched by specific characteristics such as user-defined values or application-specific parameters), are translated into the accurate formalism for automated proof.

Title: Collaborative planning, intelligent agents, and mobile computing

Abstract: The paper provides an overview of several related research projects on collaborative planning. The task of collaborative planning in dynamic environments is described and two related projects are presented. We constructed two interactive systems based on a MOO and performed a usability evaluation using task performance and subjective measures. The first system is a collection of various intelligent agent capabilities implemented in a MOO environment. We situate our system in the context of debates about definitions of agency; our agents provide online assistance to users but the extent to which they embody various theoretical ideas of agency is also of interest. The second project examines the use of hand-held computing devices in a MOO based collaborative planning environment. Basic issues of usability as well as theoretical issues in distributed collaborative planning are discussed.

Title: GISMOO: collaborative planning for civil infrastructure management in a simple Web-enhanced virtual environment

Abstract: The GISMOO project examined the collaborative planning behavior of an existing team of practitioners in the Public Works Division of a US Army base through the use of a simple Web-enhanced virtual environment. Comparisons were drawn between the behaviors of the work group while communicating face to face, and while communicating synchronously via an online virtual conference room based on MOO (Multi-user Object Oriented) technology enhanced by a Web interface. The results of this project showed that the use of an online virtual environment for collaborative planning is practical and could be beneficial, especially to physically dispersed work groups. The value of the conference room tools was not proven in this study, primarily as the structure of the scenarios did not support the asynchronous portion of the team's collaborative work well. The behavior of the work group using the collaboration tool changed in generally predictable ways as compared to face to face communication.

Title: C-SLANT: an asynchronous communications tool to support distributed work in the National Airspace System

Abstract: In recent years there have been a number of efforts under the Collaborative Decision Making (CDM) program that have demonstrated the benefits of disseminating both knowledge and goals between organizations in the National Airspace System (NAS), and of collaboratively building decision support tools to assist in the interpretation of the large interrelated dataset produced. The paper describes the development of the Collaborative SLide ANnotation Tool (C-SLANT), an asynchronous communications tool that was developed to support discussion of data from the CDM product Post Operations Evaluation Tool. It is suggested that slide show based, multi-modal, asynchronous, messaging systems appear potentially valuable in this distributed work domain for problem solving during post operations analysis.

Title: Flexible Collaborative Support: an architecture and application

Abstract: The field of computer supported cooperative work (CSCW) has led to many advances in both the study of cooperative work groups and the development of collaboration technologies. However, a number of key research issues remain. Two of these issues are: (1) the seamless integration of support for asynchronous and synchronous cooperative work, and (2) the ability for individual users to flexibly change or tailor their mode of collaboration while engaged in real time interaction. The paper describes a new approach to handling both these issues. The approach is called the Flexible Collaborative Support (FLECS) framework. It relies on the use of active database technology, an explicit organizational model, and flexible transaction management. This approach bridges the gap between CSCW and multi-user database systems. It does so by supporting awareness of other users' presence in the information space as well as providing visualization of other users' actions, thus fulfilling the most fundamental requirement of CSCW systems. At the same time, the FLECS framework capitalizes on the data security and consistency management methods which have formed the foundation of multi-user database systems. The paper also presents CityCollab and its evaluation by a community of users. CityCollab is a collaborative system, which supports the processing of Requests for Work in the context of civil infrastructure management. CityCollab represents an instantiation of the more general FLECS architecture/framework.

Title: Modeling human operators in constructive simulations through agents

Abstract: The article describes a novel approach wherein software agents observe human operator actions in an interactive simulation environment, and use genetic algorithm-based learning methods to map human operator actions to the state of the world with which the operator interacts. The state information is primarily about the environment and cockpit presented through the interface in the interactive simulation environment. The context is information processing and problem solving in a complex, dynamic, and hostile environment. The paper describes the overall approach, the components of a computational architecture, the problem scenario modeled, and preliminary results of the application.

Title: Modeling, measuring, and mediating teamwork: the use of fuzzy cognitive maps and team member schema similarity to enhance BMC/sup 3/I decision making

Abstract: A research study is reported which utilizes an AWACS based distributed decision making environment to assess: a) team interaction b) a cognitive interface containing team-level cues, c) a cognitive interface with information mediation. The hypothesis suggests that when teams are afforded an interface that suggests increased communications about team member schemas and shared situation awareness (modeled by joint cognitive processes), then team performance will increase. Results show partial support for the hypothesis for the AWACS scenarios tested. The team member schema similarity (TMSS) cues were shown to be a useful component in team effectiveness. Conclusions suggest how this research can be extended and utilized for developing cognitive interfaces and collaborative computing systems that produce shared situation awareness in complex settings.

Title: Design of warehousing and distribution systems: an object model of facilities, functions and information

Abstract: Design of warehousing and distribution systems is more an art than a science that reflects the cultures of particular design teams. Warehouses are often designed and operated by third party logistics companies with tight margins. Therefore, there is increased pressure to design warehouses that are flexible and adaptable, even while the available information is incomplete. Also, designers lack coherent and explicit models of information and function flow. The primary goal of the research discussed is to lay the foundation for developing such models. Working closely with expert designers, we have identified the key pieces of information and organized them in the form of an object model. Using this model, it should eventually be possible to provide relevant information to designers via context-sensitive (or 'ecological' or 'intelligent') displays. Upon further development, the model will be incorporated into an interactive system to assist in design. The authors describe the object model, and outline plans for implementing a design system.

Title: Capturing changes in decision-maker behavior

Abstract: A challenge for the designers of decision support systems (DSSs) is that the introduction of a decision aid into a complex domain often generates new, unexpected user needs. In this paper, we discuss how the iterative application of an experience-centered design methodology called DAISY (Design Aid for Intelligent Support SYstems) provides concrete methods for modeling these changes and identifying new system requirements caused by the introduction of the DSS. We illustrate the iterative use of DAISY in the design, evaluation and modification of Fox, a DSS intended to assist expert military users by helping them to generate and evaluate a broad range of plan options.

Title: CoRaven: model-based design of a cognitive tool for real-time intelligence monitoring and analysis

Abstract: Describes a model-based design method to develop CoRaven, a decision support tool that is intended to assist military intelligence analysts in managing and interpreting large quantities of battlefield information. In this method, we use observations of practitioners solving specific tasks in order to understand and model how they use information. We use this model of the task to help identify user needs that the tool must support, and, during initial prototyping, to guide usability analyses. We have found task models to be an important consideration in the decision support tool design process that can help to constrain the design space and reduce the time required to develop an effective decision support tool prototype.

Title: Dynamic user interface adaptation based on operator role and task models

Abstract: Proper design of human computer interactions currently requires the application of specialized knowledge possessed by talented individuals, often responding to rapidly changing technology and functionality. As computing power and data become more distributed, static design of interactions for dynamic environments may not always produce usable interfaces between people and machines. We have designed a model based, dynamic interaction design system called DIG (Dynamic Interaction Generation) and implemented it in a research prototype using the domain of digital building control systems. DIGBE is a three-tiered system modeling the domain data, the current interaction, and the device-specific presentation of the interaction. It responds to changes in the environment and creates, in real time, an interaction tailored to the current user role, access level, and task. Each interaction is also specialized to match the nature of the information that is currently the focus of the interaction. Full automatic synthesis of any interface at any time may not yet be feasible, but DIGBE demonstrates that it is both possible and useful to automatically generate user interfaces. This may be especially true for complex system domains with variable components but known task structures.

Title: The use of inductive inference models to understand human performance in supervisory control domains

Abstract: The paper proposes a methodology to understand human performance in complex supervisory control domains through the use of inductive inference methods, and E. Brunswik's (1955) lens framework. Operators in today's highly automated control systems are confronted with vast arrays of information. In order to design effective workspaces in these domains, therefore, researchers must understand information demand and utilization from a systems perspective. That is, to understand system information requirements, one must attempt to understand the diagnosticity of information in the task domain, as well as the utility of the information by human operators. The paper outlines a framework, in the spirit of Brunswik's lens model, to represent information utility and diagnosticity. Within this framework, a computational inductive inference model is described which seeks to capture human decision policies, as well as to provide a method of comparing these policies to the information environment.

Title: Scriptor: using deictics, dialog, and supervised learning to convey instructions

Abstract: HTML pages are designed to convey semantic information to human users through visual emphases, demarcations, spatial cues and repeating patterns which act as "perceptual markup". This human-centric syntax is not easy for machines to identify. Naturally-occurring HTML, especially the machine-generated variety, rarely follows strict markup rules and provides no semantic cues. The visual cues humans use to extract information from a Web page, however, must be reflected in the page's markup. If a human could convey the relationship between visual cues, available to the program as markup patterns, and semantic categories, passed to the program as user-supplied labels, the program would have been instructed in "how to extract information from that page". Scriptor is a program which, run in tandem with a Web browser, allows a user to interactively design a data extraction script for the Web site. It is intended for highly structured repetitive information such as is found in classified listings, online stores, tables for weather, stock or airline schedules, course listings, and other similar sources. Scriptor interleaves a variety of learning methods to allow the specification of extraction rules using extremely simple methods. These consist of repeating pattern recognition, supervised learning, deictics through highlighting, and dialogs in which the user selects the desired result for a set of possible extraction rules. Learning is augmented by direct instructions such as: "label text following '/spl sim/' as 'Author' ". Performance data for the authors and naive subjects are presented for a collection of Web pages showing the potential of this form of highly interactive instruction. Our results demonstrate that very simple programming by example techniques can generate effective parse rules in highly repetitive domains.

Title: Task characteristics and intelligent aiding [route-planning tasks]

Abstract: Describes the interactions between task characteristics and human agent interfaces in a team rendezvous route-planning task. The agents include an interface agent and two different task agents that perform similar tasks. The MokSAF (Mock modular Semi-Automated Forces) interface agent links an artificial intelligence (AI) route planning agent to a geographic information system (GIS). Through this agent, the user specifies a start and an end point, and describes the composition and characteristics of a military platoon. Two aided conditions and one non-aided condition were examined. In the first aided condition, an autonomous route-planning agent (RPA) determines a minimum-cost path between the specified end points. The user is allowed to define additional "intangible" constraints that describe situational or social information that should be considered when determining the route. In the second aided condition, a different agent, a cooperative RPA, uses the same knowledge of the terrain and cost functions available to the autonomous RPA, but restricts its search to paths within regions drawn by the user. In the unaided condition (the naive RPA), the user draws the route manually, then submits it to be tested against the terrain and cost functions for feasibility. Both aided conditions are superior to the control but differ in their relative effectiveness by scenario. In this paper, we examine the varieties of challenges faced by commanders in two scenarios and relate them to the differential effectiveness of the agents.

Title: Web-based tutoring from a knowledge library

Abstract: With modern technology, rapid change characterizes complex dynamic systems, including the practitioners' role and required knowledge. Training in safety-critical domains must occur in a timely manner and ensure that practitioners understand changing systems and procedures. Web-based training provides an excellent opportunity to address these issues because distribution of training can be timely, easily accessed and cost-efficient. Few sophisticated training systems exist for practitioners of complex dynamic systems. GT-ITACS (Georgia Tech Intelligent Architecture for Complex Systems) was designed and implemented as an intelligent tutoring system (ITS) "shell" to support several ongoing Georgia Tech ITS research efforts. Access to domain-specific education and training from a Web-based library may meet the needs of training programs by allowing easy access to ongoing education and training material.

Title: The systematic application of the apprenticeship learning pedagogy to computer tutorial design

Abstract: Describes the Collaborative Apprenticeship Learning Object Toolkit (CALOT), an architecture that forms the basis of a family of tutoring systems. It utilizes the apprenticeship model of learning for the study of operational procedures where theory and practice are both important. Systems built upon the CALOT architecture can be utilized by multiple, non-colocated students in a synchronous manner. A distributed set of students can collaborate on the tutorial in real-time. The development of this type of computer tutorial system is driven by the goal of linking theoretical knowledge with practical operational experience. Active, exploratory, apprentice-style learning is supported via modes of operation within the system. The student can flexibly choose to observe the expert perform and explain operational steps, or to act as an apprentice and carry out the steps autonomously. The student can switch between these modes at their discretion, giving the student control of the level of intervention by the system. Furthermore, the student can explore and reflect on an information space of object designations, procedures and related concepts. Two examples tutorials based on the CALOT architecture are the Collaborative Virtual Spectrometer and the Virtual X-Ray Diffractometer, which teach about NMR spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction, respectively. Finally, BAUEN (Basic AUthoring ENvironment) is a GUI system that helps the software developer designer author a CALOT-based computer tutorial system with maximum efficiency, focusing the developer's efforts on domain content, and not on the system implementation.

Title: OFMspert II: intelligent tutoring for complex control

Abstract: This paper begins with a discussion of the perceived requirement for general psychological models to underpin the design of human interaction with complex systems. A proposal is made that general psychological models may not be necessary, if indeed possible to create, for many applications of interest. For the applications of interest, cognitive engineering or human-machine systems models, such as the operator function model (OFM), may suffice. Next, a brief overview of the current state of OFM and its computational implementation, OFMspert, is presented. It describes how OFMspert has been extended to support the design of two intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) for operational control of safety-critical systems. An intelligent tutoring system requires two models: an expert model and a student model. This paper describes how the OFM can serve as the basis of the expert model and the OFMspert architecture as the basis for the architecture of the tutor itself.

Title: An on-line tutor for warehouse design

Abstract: Even though the methodologies for warehouse design are taught in traditional industrial engineering programs, students often find it difficult to develop the skills necessary to complete actual designs. The difficulty in translating the textbook knowledge of using the analytical and mathematical tools for design stem from their lack of experience in using such tools for designing warehouses of reasonable levels of fidelity compared to real systems. It is often very difficult to incorporate large datasets and the computational algorithms necessary during the different phases of warehouse design into the course material. As part of a larger research effort to develop a comprehensive collection of online teaching materials integrated into the undergraduate and graduate curricula, we have developed a warehouse design tutor in which additional functionality is constantly being added. Certain key details of the tutor are discussed in this paper.

Title: Re-generation of facial image eye-contacting with partner on TV conference environment

Abstract: We have been developing a method for recognition of facial parts such as eyes, nose, mouth, etc. The paper concentrates on eye (iris) recognition using a Hough transform. Based on this iris recognition, the paper proposes a basic idea and method for re-generating a facial image which is making eye-contact with a partner in a TV conference environment. We propose a new methodology for realizing a natural human interface of face-to-face communication in a TV conference environment. Since a human is likely to look at the face of her partner on a TV monitor and not at the TV camera, she will usually fail to send her own eye-contacted facial images. The basic idea of the paper is to solve this unfortunate communication degradation by regenerating a facial image by changing the direction of the irises in the same original facial image. The proposed methods and experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness. Future problems include improving the regeneration method of irises, introducing a real time processing method, coping with the motion of the head, and finally proposing a new eye-camera system which could reduce the constraints caused by head mounted goggles. This new method of eye-camera is also introduced.

Title: Factory worker-oriented programless visual inspection system

Abstract: When inspection equipment based on visual recognition is integrated into production sites, the recognition logic is custom designed to satisfy the specific inspection specification, normally requiring constant attention and recognition program modifications by specialty engineers. In order to improve the situation, the paper proposes "programless (programming-free) visual recognition technology", a core technology used in inspection equipment that can autonomously improve the recognition algorithm by feeding human know-how back into the system. As a step to realizing the objective, the matching kernel adjustment agent, inspection logic database and macro commands are described.

Title: Adaptive reconstruction of anatomical surfaces from human body measurements

Abstract: A technique that adaptively fits a deformable Bezier surface to partial or whole human body measurements for free-form surface reconstruction is described. The proposed method utilizes an unconventional neural network, called a Bernstein basis function (BBF) network, which performs a weighted summation of rational Bernstein polynomial basis functions. Modifying the number of basis neurons is equivalent to changing the degree of the Bernstein polynomials. Each BBF network determines the control points of a low-order rational Bezier surface that best approximates the shape of randomly organized coordinate data. A key feature of the algorithm is that the measured data does not have to be re-ordered or parameterized prior to fitting. In addition, the rational Bezier surface retains the relative position of the parametric coordinates (u,v) as it deforms. Once the adaptation phase is complete, the weights of the network can be entered directly into a variety of commercially available geometric modeling and CAD/CAM packages for shape reconstruction. An experimental study is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the BBF network for generating rational Bezier surfaces.

Title: Automated trend diagnosis using neural networks

Abstract: The paper presents a new method for a trend diagnosis system using neural networks. Most dynamical systems are not easy to analyze and faults are difficult to detect because the observed parameters do not directly express the state of the system. We need to measure the temporal tendencies of the parameters, which isn't easy for testing machines or humans. The effectiveness of the trend fault diagnosis system using recurrent neural networks is examined for an air-conditioning system. The network was trained with faulty and correct data sequences obtained from system simulation. The experimental fault detection results using actual data proved that the proposed method is effective for performing trend diagnosis of dynamic systems.

Title: Concept design visualization-a component-based approach

Abstract: The paper presents a new framework and design methodology for concept-level systems design. The central part of the framework is an introduction of the components to represent the systems concept. The framework utilizes these components to navigate the designer's exploration to obtain subsystems and semiautomatically integrates subsystems into one whole system. The design exploration (DE) components are a set of abstractions of the design exploration activities. A design history is recorded as a dependency graph of the DE components. The systems integration (SI) components are a set of relationships between subsystems from the systems integration perspective. Using SI components, the designer can design the system's hierarchical structure as a graph, the systems integration graph. By introducing a common semantic ground for these components, a design navigation algorithm and a conversion algorithm from the design history to the systems integration graph are introduced.

Title: The design and implementation of a learning collaboratory

Abstract: Early CAI efforts focused on the transmission or delivery of knowledge to the student. Subsequent work in intelligent tutoring systems took a more cognitive approach and attempted to emulate the behavior of skilled human tutors via software. More recent work has focused on collaborative learning processes, and the idea of a collaboratory as a virtual space for work. This paper describes a design process to support the development and use of collaborative learning technologies. This process, the Learning Collaboratory Design Framework (LuCiDiFy), integrates methods and concepts from cognitive systems engineering, theories of learning and instruction, distributed computing and computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL). LuCiDiFy is instantiated in an actual software testbed, the Collaborative Learning Environment for Operational Systems (CLEOS). CLEOS is a collaboratory for teachers, students and practitioners in the physical sciences, and in particular for NMR spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction experiments. CLEOS includes two virtual instrument tutorials, CVS (Collaborative Virtual Spectrometer) and VXRD (Virtual X-Ray Diffractometer); an asynchronous messaging system, the Question Board (QB); a project-based design environment, TOSP (Tool for Organizing and Supervising Projects); and an architecture for developing collaborative apprenticeship learning systems, CALOT (Collaborative Apprenticeship Learning Object Toolkit); an authoring environment, BAUEN (Basic AUthoring ENvironment); and a collaborative multi-user domain (MUD) infrastructure, MudSpot.

Title: Complexity metrics for Petri net based logic control algorithms

Abstract: In the area of automatic control, more and more tasks formerly solved using special hardware are being solved using software. Hence, when discussing quality in automation, it is necessary to measure the quality of a software product. Software quality is a field of major interest for researchers and practitioners. However, in the area of control engineering, it is rarely studied. In previous publications the authors introduced the concept of transparency and defined corresponding metrics to measure the quality of logic controllers. In addition to these metrics, known complexity metrics from computer science are adapted to the area of logic control design and it is shown how the concepts of complexity and transparency are related. The metrics are introduced using the signal interpreted Petri net, but they are also valid for other Petri net types.

Title: Simulation of human-oriented production processes aimed at providing higher worker satisfaction

Abstract: Human-oriented production systems that maximize human abilities are being recognized anew for their effectiveness. In this paper, we propose a simulation model for a U-shaped production line, a typical human-oriented production system. The model consists of some "worker agents" and conventional simulation logic. The agents include logic as to which human factors (such as communications among workers and operation speed variation according to the surrounding work conditions) are introduced. In several simulation experiments, we verified that the proposed model provides an approach to both higher productivity and higher worker satisfaction.

Title: Trace visualization and analysis tool for supervisory control systems

Abstract: Much time has been taken to examine supervisory control systems in their software engineering processes. Trace analysis has been one of the effective methods in proceeding with this examination since traces represent the actual flow of events in the systems. We have developed a trace analysis tool to help us with system understanding. The tool analyzes traces and extracts the kind of event, when it completed and which tasks it involved. It also visualizes the flow of events and the interaction that had taken place between tasks on the screen. The typical feature of the tool is to identify frequent event patterns such as periodic patterns by extending the algorithm for text data compression. We applied the tool to the engineering process of rail traffic control systems, and found the tool was effective in reducing the time for simplifying understanding of the dynamic behaviours of the system and finding problem areas.

Abstract: This paper is concerned with the patterns of joint angles of the lower extremity of the body (hip, knee and ankle angle) during the termination of human gait. The termination of human gait is defined as the transition from a steady-state gait to a quiet standing posture. The transition between these two states has not been extensively studied and defined. There appears to be a critical period in the gait cycle in which the decision to terminate the gait or to continue to take an additional step must be made.

Title: The effects of synchronization of temporal structures of sound and motion picture on the impression of audio-visual contents

Abstract: To clarify the effects of the temporal structure of sound and motion pictures on the impression of audio-visual contents, the impression of various kinds of audio-visual combinations was measured by a semantic differential method. The experimental variables of audio-visual stimuli are the speed of the motion picture, the tempo of the auditory stimulus and the temporal relationship between the visual and auditory accents. The synchronization of visual and auditory accents raises the subjective congruency of the audio-visual contents. The matching of auditory tempo and visual speed also affects the subjective congruency. The subjective impact is stronger as the speed of the motion picture becomes faster. The accent synchronization also contributes to the strong impact of the audio-visual contents. The subjective "lightness" is determined by the musical tempo. Faster music causes a lighter impression of the audio-visual contents. The subjective complexity is based on an imbalance between the visual and auditory speeds. The mismatching of musical tempo and visual speed evokes a complex feeling of audiovisual contents.

Title: Effect of instruments arrangement for human monitoring behavior

Abstract: We carried out two experiments in order to investigate the affective factors for sampling behavior in a multiple-instruments setting. The first experiment was conducted in order to test whether or not the sampling behavior would always be affected by the arrangements of fast instruments. The second experiment was designed to compare the effect of the shape of arrangements with one of eye transitions during trials, and revealed which of them affected the sampling behavior more strongly. In the sampling behavior of multiple instruments, the fast instruments were mainly sampled and the sampling performance was better in condition where the fast instruments were located in a single group. Furthermore, it was confirmed that the eye transitions affected the sampling performance more strongly than the shape of the arrangements under certain conditions.

Title: Influence of a priori knowledge into subjective evaluation of mental commit robot

Abstract: Recent advances in robotics have been applied to automation in industrial manufacturing, with the primary purpose of optimizing practical systems in terms of such objective measures as accuracy, speed and cost. This paper introduces research on a mental commit robot that seeks a different direction that is not so rigidly dependent on such objective measures. The main goal of this research is to explore a new area in robotics, with an emphasis on human-robot interaction. In the previous research, we introduced a cat robot and evaluated it by interviewing many people. The results showed that physical interaction improved subjective evaluation. However, some subjects gave severe comments on the structure of the robot when they interacted with it physically. Because of the appearance of the cat robot, subjects associated with a real cat depending on their own experiences and knowledge, and then compared the robot with a real cat. We investigate the influence of a priori knowledge into subjective interpretation and evaluation of a mental commit robot. We developed a new seal robot that has the appearance of a baby harp seal. Most people did not know the harp seal exactly nor have any experience of interaction with it. Then, subjects evaluated the seal robot while interacting with it.

Title: Combining adaptive teleoperations with force reflection

Abstract: Considers telerobots with variable parameters, which are intended to solve manipulation problems when fast transportation operations are combined with high-precision positioning operations. Manipulator gain is used as a parameter for the flexible control of the system characteristics that introduces an additional channel of parameter adjustment into the system. A method to synthesise control algorithms for these systems is presented. Also, this article discusses force reflection approaches for these robots. It is concluded that the most promising approach consists of information transmission to human skin receptors by means of skin displays. Some solutions in implementing this approach are described.

Title: An attempt of feeling analysis by the nasal temperature change model

Abstract: We attempted the estimation of emotions using thermal images when watching video programs. In modern psychology, it was suggested that human emotions are expressed as a vector in the plane, which is with the pleasantness and arousal axis. We studied the pleasant-unpleasant (P-U) estimation model and the arousal-sleepiness (A-S) estimation model using multivariate regression. We examined the effectiveness of the analysis model and we tried emotion analysis.

Title: Trade-off relationship between width and depth of visual information processing in measurement of functional visual field

Abstract: A method to measure the functional visual field was proposed, and the trade-off between the width of functional visual field and the depth of cognitive information processing was quantitatively verified. The missing rate on the peripheral vision tended to increase with the increase of both task complexity on the foveal vision and visual angle. The percentage correct of the addition task at the foveal vision tended to decrease with the increase of the visual angle of the peripheral stimuli. The percentage correct, however, did not differ among four levels of task complexity. It tended that the response time to the peripheral stimuli increased with the increase of the task complexity. These results indicated that the visual resource available for visual information processing was limited. On the basis of these results, we empirically propose a quantitative model that can explain the trade-off relationship between the width of functional visual field and the depth of cognitive information processing.

Title: Evaluation of visual fatigue during VDT tasks

Abstract: This study was designed to evaluate visual fatigue induced during VDT tasks using newly developed equipment that can simultaneously measure pupillary change, focal accommodation and eye movement. The changes in these three physiological measures, taken during a VDT task, were used to propose an index for evaluating visual fatigue. Through multiple regression analysis, an index to describe the psychological sense of visual fatigue was obtained. In this index, the minimum pupil diameter, velocity of focal accommodation for constriction, and width of focal accommodation were included. The results showed that visual fatigue resulting from a VDT task includes not one factor but multiple factors. The index shows that visual fatigue in VDT tasks can be evaluated effectively using both pupil diameter and focal accommodation. This index enables us to assess visual fatigue induced during a VDT task.

Title: Development of hydraulic bilateral-servo actuator for powered orthosis

Abstract: The development of a machine that supports the movement of the upper limbs has not proceeded for paraplegics. This is because a large output power is necessary in order to move a robot arm while supporting the paralysed body. We propose a new actuator system, called the Hydraulic Bilateral-Servo Actuator (HBSA) system, which has been developed in our laboratory to be applied to powered orthosis with seven degrees of freedom.

Title: Assessment of extra high quality images using both EEG and assessment words on high order sensations

Abstract: Beyond the conventional idea that high resolution is equal to high quality on a computer screen, we are making basic research to develop the extra high quality imaging system, which can convey high order sensations. High order sensations mean highly artistic impressions and emotional information. We have carried out an assessment test of extra high quality images by subjective and objective methods. Extra high quality images can convey high order sensations, which include high quantization for one of the important physical factors. We have assessed image quality versus quantization level. It has been observed that, in EEG measurement, the power of /spl alpha/-EEG has been higher value in images with higher quantization level, especially in the "MIROKU" image (a kind of Buddha's image, monochrome). It is expected that EEG measurement is able to assess high order sensations included in extra high quality images practically.

Title: A method to measure muscular fatigue in VDT tasks

Abstract: This study was designed to evaluate localized muscular fatigue induced during VDT tasks, using an experimental paradigm where EMG signals were not recorded during the VDT task but during isometric contractions in which the load imposed on the shoulder muscle was kept constant. The change in MPF and the root mean square (RMS) values of EMG signals with time was explored. The correspondence between these measures and the psychological rating of localized muscular fatigue was also examined. On the basis of the results, the effectiveness of the experimental paradigm and of the measures used for evaluation of localized muscular fatigue was discussed. As a result, MPF measured during isometric contraction was found to be a sensitive measure of localized muscular fatigue.

Title: Anthropomorphic hand control for robotic hand-arm system

Abstract: The aim of our research is to develop an anthropomorphic five-digit robotic hand and arm with a hand-arm cooperative control system. We define the human hand to compose an active 21 D.O.F. structure, having a 1-D.O.F. flexible palm, on the base of Kapandji's (1970) physiological study of the human hand. The hand and arm actions are categorized and analyzed to draw the relation in the upper limb movements. A 16 D.O.F robotic hand is designed as a test bed for evaluating the hypothesis and to propose a guide for the mechanical design and synchronous sequential multiple motor control for anthropomorphic hand-arm cooperating movements. The design of the robotic hand, the categorization, and the relative networking characteristic of the upper limb joints are discussed in this paper.

Title: Dependence of human adaptation and risk compensation on modification in level of automation for system safety

Abstract: We examine the dependence of risk compensatory human adaptation to a system to attain safety of everyday machines, such as cars, on the level of automation and its shift. Two experiments were conducted using a microworld that is closely related to driving. The first experiment clarifies differences in the operation method and in risks involved in operation among different levels of automation. The results show that risk compensatory adaptation is significant if the computer of the safety system not only provides warning, but also performs safety control actions when necessary. In addition, even if the automation functions properly, new types of accidents arise, so that the number of accidents may not decline. The second experiment examines the dependence of human adaptation to a safety system on the direction of level shift of automation. The results show that the risk reducing adaptation when the level of automation decreases is not as significant as the risk compensatory adaptation when the level of automation increases.

Title: Control characteristics of two humans in cooperative task

Abstract: Control systems for cooperative robots should be designed to work imitating human characteristics. So it is important to know the human characteristics in a cooperative task, i.e. carrying an object by two humans. In this study, we have tried to achieve these goals by means of controlling a simple one degree-of-freedom cooperative robot. Firstly, the control characteristics of two humans in the cooperative task are investigated. Then, the cooperative task is modelled and the parameters of the model are evaluated. Finally, the proposed model is implemented to control a robot in order to perform a cooperative task with humans. It is observed that the proposed control methodology has given human like movements to the robot for cooperating with a human.

Title: Object-oriented fusion-diffusion mechanism to handle crisp and linguistic information for better human-system interface

Abstract: To integrate computing with words (CW) (L.A. Zadeh, 1996) and ordinary computation, an object oriented fusion-diffusion mechanism is developed and proposed with respect to an object oriented system analysis and design framework. The object type fusion is used to glue a set of linguistically defined object types to create a new object type that transforms crisp information into linguistic and primitive format. The object type diffusion is used to unglue a linguistic object type, given as the opposite of the fusion mechanism. It transforms a linguistic format of the input and results in a constituent crisp and primitive format. The bra-ket (R.P. Feynann et al., 1965) and left-right parenthesis notation are introduced to formulate the mechanisms. It is shown that analyzing and designing the human user interface of a sophisticated information system is aided by this method. Accordingly, we give an outline of our new analysis and design method influenced by the fusion-diffusion mechanism. A multimedia system, data warehouse, and teleportation system are briefly examined as examples.

Title: A study of characteristics of pointing devices for television operation

Abstract: We aim to clarify the operating characteristics of key-type, trackball-type and gyroscope-type pointing devices for television operation via a graphical user interface (GUI). First, we examined whether the operating characteristics of the three types of pointing device depended on the viewing distance. The results showed that the operating characteristics of the three kinds of pointing device did not depend on viewing distance. Next, we compared the operating characteristics of the pointing devices in two tasks: when the distance to the target was long, and when it was short. The results suggested that the gyroscope type was easier to operate than the other two types, judging from the relation between the gain and the pointing time.

Title: A violin playing algorithm considering the change of phrase impression

Abstract: The study focuses on the dynamics of KANSEI information and aims to propose an algorithm of motion planning using KANSEI. Concretely, the violin playing is regarded as the target motion which will be greatly influenced by KANSEI. The study introduces a multi-agent algorithm in which four physical bowing parameters are agents to adapt the impression transition smoothly, while maintaining the relationships between the parameters. We realized the violin performance suitable for the timbre words by introducing the proposed agent algorithm into the bowing machine developed in this research. As a result of the experiments, it was confirmed that there were various playing performances according to a single impression transition.

Title: Operator's situation awareness under different levels of automation; evaluations through probabilistic human cognitive simulations

Abstract: The human-centered automation concept claims two general requirements on situation awareness (SA) of human operators. One is the necessity of keeping the SA of an artifact, and the other is keeping the SA of automation. Nevertheless, the fundamental methods or techniques, especially quantitative ones, are not mature enough to be used as rational tools for human-machine design. An important approach for establishing the method must be identification of a proper "level of automation", where ten levels are proposed by T.B. Sheridan (1999). A goal of the research presented is to establish a theoretical framework for evaluating automation levels from a viewpoint of operator's situation awareness in real domains. A method using discrete event simulation is developed, and applied to a particular artifact: a nuclear power plant.

Title: A multi-technique approach for user identification through keystroke dynamics

Abstract: Legitimate user authentication is an important part of the problems related to computer and system security. The maintenance of security becomes even more difficult when an invalid user gets the system access information. The paper presents a suite of techniques for password authentication using neural networks, fuzzy logic, statistical methods, and several hybrid combinations of these approaches. The approaches presented in the paper use typing biometrics of a user, in addition to conventional login information, to identify a user.

Title: Dynamic registration for augmented reality in telerobotics applications

Abstract: The paper presents a solution to the dynamic registration problem in augmented reality for telerobotics applications. The objective is to align the virtual camera used to render a 3D graphical replica of a robot manipulator with the real camera, providing images from the work site. We proceed in two steps: first, a static registration process requiring the intervention of the operator; next, a dynamic registration process that continuously and automatically updates the registration data. Our dynamic algorithm relies on feature tracking and an extended Kalman filter for state estimation. We present experimental results for the dynamic registration algorithm and discuss possible extensions and improvements of the method.

Title: Mathematical characterization of human reliability for multi-task system operations

Abstract: The article provides a mathematical reliability methodology for estimating the contribution of the human operator in a human-machine system. The methodology is applicable to high value, high risk human-machine operations where failures can be catastrophic and costly such as rendezvous and docking of a space craft at the International Space Station, critical control activities in a nuclear power plant, etc. The methodology consists of a mathematical probabilistic conceptual approach for the analytical characterization of human reliability for multi-task system operation. From a system perspective, reliability for a system includes three different reliability elements: (1) hardware reliability, (2) software reliability, and (3) human reliability. Therefore, the reliability of a system is just as constrained by the reliability of the human operator as it is by the reliability of the hardware and software. The elements of the bathtub curve for human reliability are constructed analogous to comparable elements of the bathtub curve for hardware reliability. This human error rate bathtub curve concept enables the formulation of a useful, workable mathematical modeling process for human reliability (R.E. Giuntini and W.R. Wessels, 1997). The results consist of a fully developed method that can be applied to quantify human reliability in a human-machine system. A detailed mathematical process of each of the three error rate phases: (1) learning error rate phase, (2) stabilized error rate phase, and (3) fatigue error rate phase is presented in terms of the Weibull probability distribution to characterize the human reliability process.

Title: Discretionary behavior switching: analysis and synthesis results

Abstract: In previous work, we addressed how the world sometimes mandates switches in human behaviors (M.A. Goodrich et al., 1999). This led to a characterization of how humans manage such mandatory transitions. In addition to mandatory behavior switches, there are also situations where humans exhibit discretionary behavior switches. The authors present a mathematical characterization of discretionary behavior switches which is applicable to both modeling human behavior generation as well as to developing action selection mechanisms for behavior based robotics. We support this model by analyzing behaviors observed in human subjects and by synthesizing behaviors in a mobile robot.

Title: Human detection and localization at indoor environment by home robot

Abstract: The system introduced in the paper estimates the 3D position of a human's head and face by using the depth from focus method. First the system locates the human's head and face by using motion detection, Hough transform and a statistical color model. Then by changing pan, tilt and zoom of camera we put the face in the center of the camera's field of view. Then we use information from focusing the ring of an autofocus camera to measure the distance between the human face and the camera. By having information about the absolute position of the camera and its pan and tilt angles we can compute the absolute position of the person in the room. In the case of a person with small motions, this system measures distance with less than a 10 cm error. The measurable distance range is from 90 cm up to 340 cm.

Title: Controlling non-verbal information in speaker-change for spoken dialogue

Abstract: The authors focus on two main topics concerning a model for use of non-verbal information. The first topic is the clarification of the difference of the model between using non-verbal information by human beings and using non-verbal information by robot. The other topic is the clarification of the difference of the model between a CG simulated robot and a real robot. As a result, we clarified the strength of constraint and naturalness of various types of non-verbal information. We also confirmed that appropriate output timing of non-verbal information with the CG robot is the start of utterances. This is the same as the usage of non-verbal information in human-human dialogue. Moreover, we confirmed that non-verbal information made speaker change more smooth for the humanoid robot than in the case of the CG robot.

Title: Two-step approach for real-time eye tracking with a new filtering technique

Abstract: Head and face detection and eye tracking in real time are the first steps for head gesture recognition and/or face expression recognition for a human-computer interaction interface. We propose a two-step approach for eye tracking in video streams. First, we detect or track a point between the eyes. For this task, we apply a special filter that we have proposed previously (Proc. IEEE 4th Int. Conf. on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition, pp. 40-45, 2000). Once we have detected the point between the eyes, it is fairly easy to locate the eyes, which are the two small darkest parts on each side of this point. Because detecting a point between the eyes is easier and more stable than detecting the eyes directly, the system can track the eyes robustly. We implemented the system on an SGI O2 workstation. The video image size is 320/spl times/240 pixels. The system processes images at seven frames per second in the detection mode and at 13 frames per second in the tracking mode, without any special hardware.

Title: Facial features for identification

Abstract: A person identification system is presented in this paper. The system exploits the localised self-similarity in face images in order to develop an identification method. The identification method is insensitive to partial image variations that are due to translation, rotation or scale. The performance of the system is evaluated by studying the results of its application to ensembles of face images.

Title: Tracking a driver's hands using computer vision

Abstract: The paper describes a computer vision system for tracking a driver's hands. The applications of such a system are discussed with particular attention given to the control of a novel vehicle systems interface. This interface is controlled by pointing at the required function on a display mounted behind the top of the steering wheel. The vision system must detect and track the driver's hands to allow efficient recovery of a search space in which to look for a pointing finger. Cameras mounted above the driver provide images of the steering wheel area. The scene is segmented using adaptive background and foreground models. A distance transform is applied to the resulting contours. A geometric model is fitted to the resulting distance map by maximising an objective function over the model parameters in a local search space defined by the output of a Kalman filter. The appearance-based model fitting process can resolve ambiguous situations such as the hands touching or crossing, and parting again. The system is demonstrated running at 10 Hz on a standard PC.

Title: A morphing technique for facial image representation

Abstract: Presents a method for the representation of facial images. The proposed method consists of two modules: face-image matching and face-image morphing. In the first module, the correspondence between two images are calculated for all pixel locations. A novel area-based matching method is proposed that makes use of the concept of the fractal dimension, and develops a non-parametric local transform as a basis for establishing the correspondence between two face images. In the second module, a mapping is performed for deformation of the source face image on to the target face image. This is done to map the pixels in the source face image to the location of their corresponding pixels in the target image.

Title: Selective coding of human faces using wavelets

Abstract: Proposes an automated selective coding algorithm for human faces using neural networks and wavelets. In the proposed coding algorithm, we try to preserve information about human faces as much as possible without compromising the overall compression efficiency. In particular, we want to eliminate the artifacts near the boundary between the face and the background. We first extract the facial area using the eye location information and the skin color information. When we allocate bits at each level in the wavelet transform, we allocate more bits to the area that corresponds to the facial area. Experiments show that we can obtain a crisper facial area at the expense of the background.

Title: Generation of 3D model with super resolved texture from image sequence

Abstract: Proposes a method for the reconstruction of a 3D shape with super-resolved texture of a book surface by integrating the shape that is recovered from an image sequence taken with a moving camera. The image sequence is divided into a number of blocks. A factorization method is applied to each block to obtain part of the 3D shape of the object. The 3D shapes reconstructed from the blocks of the sequence are merged into a single integrated 3D model. During this time, we generate a super-resolved texture using multiple images. For the merging, the position and pose of each 3D shape is adjusted based on the surface normal of the overlapped area. The merged 3D model of all regions of the book surface is shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Furthermore, we generate a super-resolved texture that is finer than the original image using multiple images.

Title: Super resolving texture mapping from multiple view images for 3D model construction

Abstract: There are wide varieties of applications of 3D modeling from real images, which can generate virtual view images by rendering the input images on to a 3D shape model. Because the virtual viewpoint is not generally at the same point, the synthesized image in a virtual view does not have sufficient resolution. To improve this resolution problem, we propose a method for improving the rendered texture resolution. For each vertex of the 3D shape model, the position of the vertex is adjusted to improve the texture of the neighboring triangle patches. For the improvement, the position of the vertex is adjusted by comparing the observation (input image) with the projected image of the model texture. By repeating the visit to every vertex, not only can a super-resolved texture be obtained but also a more accurate 3D patch model. By performing experiments using synthesized multiple-view images of 51 calibrated cameras around the object scene and a real VTR image sequence, it is demonstrated that the proposed method can successfully provide a super-resolved texture image with an improved 3D shape model.

Title: Mesh simplification with average planes for 3-D image

Abstract: Mesh simplification is a very important stage in 3D image construction. In most cases, a model consists of many triangles. It is difficult to render, transmit and store the model data. This paper proposes a mesh simplification method based on computing the average planes combined by using the adjacent vertices of every edge and all two-edge vertices. We compute the RMS (root mean square) distance error of all these vertices from the edge to the average plane. Two RMS error values (the edge length and a penalty item) are combined to produce the final error metric. According to this value, the curvature of the facet can be decided. The edge with the lowest error metric is selected to be collapsed. A model without a boundary and two models with a boundary are used to test the efficiency of the proposed method.

Title: Fast multiresolution modeling of 3D objects using mesh-based wavelet analysis

Abstract: We propose a method of generating multiresolution triangulated meshes from range data clouds for modeling 3D objects. Such meshes can be obtained by applying wavelet analysis techniques directly to a fine mesh if it is equivalent in topology to a tetrahedron subdivided by a recursive 4-to-1 splitting algorithm. However, a mesh of this special characteristic is difficult to construct by a traditional meshing method, and hence another time-consuming remeshing process has to be used. To solve the problem, we try to get a topologically proper coarse mesh automatically from any given dataset. Then, finer meshes are produced by applying the 4-to-1 subdivision algorithm recursively, resulting in multiresolution meshes in an efficient manner.

Title: Quantitative and qualitative comparison of three laser-range mapping algorithms using two types of laser scanner data

Abstract: Presents our initial results in comparing three algorithms for autonomous robotic mapping using two types of laser scanner data. The algorithms compared are the Markov localization approach of S. Thrun et al. (1998), F. Lu and E. Milios's (1997) iterative dual correspondence algorithm, and C. Touzet's (2000) model-free landmark extraction algorithm. The two types of laser scanner data utilized are the AccuRange laser scanner from Acuity and the SICK laser scanner. We compare these algorithms in terms of the quality of mapped results, computational requirements, and sensitivity to data and odometry errors. While the complete comparison of these algorithms on all these measures is not yet accomplished, our results to date indicate that laser mapping algorithms are not immediately transferrable from one type of laser scanner data to another. Instead, algorithms appear to make implicit assumptions on the quality or content of laser data that play a strong role in the quality of the mapping results.

Title: Fusing 3D shapes at different view points to obtain more accurate shape

Abstract: We obtain an exact 3D model of a scene using multiple images from different camera positions. The recovery of a 3D shape using two images has problems such as being weak in noise. Therefore we present methods to improve the accuracy of 3D shapes with multiple images. The system is divided into three stages: (1) the recovery of 3D shapes from different viewpoints, (2) fusing the 3D shapes to obtain a para-ideal shape, and (3) removing the outlier shapes and feature points by an evaluation function, and fusing the rest of the shapes. We demonstrate a significant improvement in the recovered shape. Experimental results show that our system performs well in removing noise with robustness. The maximum noise reduction rate was 82% in real image experiments.

Title: Sensor fusion with spatial uncertainties in a holonic multirobot workcell

Abstract: A holonic multi-robot cell is a cell specifying a system based on autonomous and cooperative units called holons. This paper presents a method using Bayesian estimation to model uncertainties in a multi-robot cell. Using sensor fusion with several robots and combining all the information together gives new possibilities for planning the sensing operations, e.g. to minimize the size of locating measurements. If the robots and work object are accurately modelled (noise model and surface forms), an iterative planner can be used to plan a minimal task sequence for the treatment of the work object. Further analysis of the remaining uncertainties is based on observing the direction of the eigenvectors and the respective eigenvalues of the error covariance matrix.

Title: Reactive assembly planning in a dynamic virtual environment

Abstract: Working in the virtual environment has the advantage of unsurpassed support from computer tools. However, its success in industrial applications still relies on how accurately a virtual environment represents the real-life activities. Presented in this paper is a method of reactive assembly planning that is able to handle environmental uncertainty. It uses automatic object modeling to update the virtual environment according to the changes in a working environment, and a biologically-inspired neural network to reactively generate collision-free paths in real time.

Title: HOLDeR: a layered system for vision-guided robotics

Abstract: HOLDeR (Hierarchical, Object-centered, Learning Dextrous Robotics) is a new approach to the problem of object-centered task execution. It balances stored object knowledge with flexibility to produce a system that is capable of manipulating a wide variety of known and unknown objects. HOLDeR utilizes a layered approach to sensory-motor coordination that enables a robot to use as much object-specific data as possible, given time and computational constraints. The architecture also incorporates learning to allow the system to adapt to new objects and new classes of objects that it encounters. HOLDeR is based upon a modification of an active deformable model technique called dynamic pressure snakes. The techniques can be adapted to a variety of robotic tasks.

Title: Hybrid video using motion estimation

Abstract: One of the major problems in low-bandwidth telerobotics applications is determining what visual data is sufficient to allow the operator to successfully perform a task. When the available bandwidth is extremely low, we must severely restrict the data being transmitted. For very-low-bandwidth applications, displaying certain types of features, such as edges in indoor navigation applications, allows for successful completion of the operator's task. As the available bandwidth increases, the operator can be presented with more information than just the edge features. Using simple overlay techniques to overlay a low-frame-rate video stream on a high-frame-rate edge feature stream provides the operator with more information about the environment. Registering the video data with the moving edge data poses a significant problem. In this paper, we propose to use simple motion estimation techniques based on the edge image stream to estimate the motion of the edge images and use this data to register the slower frame-rate video stream to the edge feature stream. Using these simple estimation techniques allows us to perform the video stream registration quickly as the edge feature data is being presented to the operator.

Title: An intelligent vision guided telerobotic system for file manipulation and office automation

Abstract: Describes a vision-guided telerobotic system that enables people with disabilities to perform clerical or office tasks. By adding a light-duty robot to the office workspace, the operator can manipulate files and perform other work-related tasks. To increase the effectiveness of the robot, vision can be used to verify that the robot is correctly positioned. In addition, vision can be be coupled with the telerobotic system to allow the user more intuitive control over the robot. Visual servoing and traditional computed kinematics actions are inappropriate for this application because visual servoing requires an excessive number of iterations and computed kinematics requires accurate calibration. To counteract these difficulties and to provide user functionality, we have designed a hybrid computed-kinematics telerobotic system with an initial coarsely-calibrated computed-kinematics step followed by a more accurate visual-servoing step. We show that there are significant performance benefits from this approach. Finally, we describe how the hybrid system may be utilized in an office environment.

Title: Intelligent wheelchair moving among people based on their observations

Abstract: With the increase in the number of senior citizens, there is a growing demand for human-friendly wheelchairs as mobility aids. One of the main issues in robotic wheelchair research is autonomous obstacle avoidance for safety. However, this is difficult because most of the moving obstacles in the real world are human beings, and they sometimes change their motion abruptly. This paper presents an intelligent wheelchair that can avoid collisions with such pedestrians (and each other) safely and comfortably. We assume that the information as to whether or not a pedestrian has noticed the wheelchair and which direction he/she wants to go can appear in the direction of the pedestrian's face. Thus, our intelligent wheelchair continuously observes the pedestrian's face in its frontal area, realizing smooth passing by changing its collision-avoidance strategy based on the face information and the range data from ultrasonic sensors. The effectiveness of the proposed method is shown by a comparative experiment with a method using only ultrasonic sensors.

Title: An active vision system for mobile robots

Abstract: An active vision system enables the selective capture of important information for various applications. With an active vision system, the control of gaze direction toward a visual target can simplify many of the robot's interactions with the world. This work presents the implementation of a camera head control system for a mobile robot, called HelpMate. Helpmate's binocular head is composed of two Sony color cameras mounted on two independent pan-tilt heads. The camera head control behavior is designed to be similar to that of human eyes, which include saccade, smooth pursuit, vergence and vestibulo-ocular reflex. Saccade allows the robot to quickly direct its gaze to the target, smooth pursuit keeps both cameras fixated on the moving target, vergence makes sure that the two cameras are looking at the same object, and vestibulo-ocular reflex compensates the camera motion for the robot body's movement. Control methods have been designed and tested through experimentation. By using color segmentation, HelpMate can detect and locate a human holding a specific colored object, who is approaching within its range. Once the target is located, the two cameras are fixated, and HelpMate's body turns toward the target. The camera head then smoothly tracks the moving target and guides the robot to follow the target as it moves.

Title: Image classifier and scene understanding systems of multiagent teams

Abstract: A multi-agent architecture for scene understanding systems is described. Such systems consist of a collection of coupled vision subsystems, each one dedicated to a particular sensor. Interaction between the vision subsystems is controlled by an organising agent. Each vision subsystem is implemented on the basis of a partition tree image labelling representation and an associated multi-agent hierarchy of classifiers controlled by an organising agent. Each classifier in the multi-agent hierarchy of classifiers may be implemented as a decision tree of neural network classifiers acting on feature vectors derived from regions in the partition tree. Therefore, the image labelling and image classification subsystems can be described in terms of hierarchical networks of neural networks from which an interpretation in terms of multi-agents follows very naturally. The vision subsystems have a multi-resolution image representation and concurrency between and within the image labelling and image classification vision subsystem components.

Title: A novel eigenvector approach to pose and correspondence estimation

Abstract: The paper proposes a novel eigenvector approach for pose and correspondence estimation between the feature points of two images or two point patterns under affine transformation. In the method, the proximity matrices, which record the normalized area features extracted from the two point sets are utilized to calculate the modes of each point set and the corresponding feature vectors. Then the point correspondence can be obtained by calculating the correlation of the feature vectors. To reduce the computation time, the idea of the principal component analysis (PCA) is adopted, which considers only the principal eigenvectors corresponding to the larger eigenvalues of each proximity matrix. As compared with the traditional eigenvector algorithm proposed by L.S. Shapiro and J.M. Brady (1992), the proposed algorithm is demonstrated to be more effective in estimating the point correspondence and the relevant parameters of affine transformation.

Title: Estimation of optical flow via voting process with weight function

Abstract: For estimation of optical flow, voting has been used in the process of detection of an intersection of constraint line in voting space. The intersections are often scattered because of the quantization of voting space, image noise, etc. The authors first analyze the intersection distribution, then they show a filtering of voting to converge the scattering by convolution with a weight function. Some experimental results of the method are also given.

Title: Analysing the geometric properties of reflected correspondence vectors for the registration of free form shapes

Abstract: The paper presents a novel algorithm for the registration of free-form shapes represented by two sets of points before and after a rigid body motion. First, the geometric properties of reflected correspondence vectors are analysed, yielding a number of rigid motion constraints bridging the points described in different coordinate frames before and after the rigid motion. Then, a novel algorithm is developed for the registration of free-form shapes, making full use of the rigid motion constraints to cope with false matches that occur in almost every iteration of the ICP algorithm. In order to improve the accuracy of the motion parameter estimation and computational efficiency, the Monte Carlo resampling technique and a median filter are employed. A number of experiments based on both synthetic data and real images demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is accurate and robust.

Title: Registration of range images with different scanning resolutions

Abstract: The paper presents a novel method of registering two range images that are taken at different 3D viewpoints. Distinct from classic methods, it allows an accurate estimation of a scaling parameter of the images in addition to the general motion parameters. It is made possible owing to the following efforts: 1) extended signature images (ESIs) are utilized to establish precise correspondence between image objects even if they are different in scale; 2) fine image alignment is achieved by incorporating scale estimates into a modified iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm. Results of experiments demonstrate the method is of practical use even for images acquired by real digitizers.

Title: A content-based image retrieval system integrating color, shape and spatial analysis

Abstract: The paper investigates image retrieval methods based on color, shape and spatial analysis. We have designed and implemented a prototype to retrieve a particular image from an image database. Indexing methods based on criteria are adopted in the prototype. An integrated method for calculating the similarity value between two images is introduced. We then evaluate the performance and compare the characteristic of each image retrieval approach in turn. Experimental results show that using color-only analysis can achieve a good image recall rate. Finally, integrating the color, shape and spatial analysis in image retrieval, the accuracy is much higher than using the techniques separately.

Title: Robust image registration based on feedforward neural networks

Abstract: A novel approach to accurate and robust image registration using feedforward neural networks is presented. Common registration schemes utilize some form of similarity measures in order to evaluate affine transformation parameters. In the proposed scheme, feedforward neural networks are employed as a means of providing translation, rotation and scaling parameters with respect to reference and observed image sets. Discrete cosine transform (DCT) features are extracted as inputs to the network. Experimental results with several deformed and noisy images indicate that the proposed algorithm is both accurate and remarkably robust to diverse noisy conditions.

Title: Stereo correspondence using Hopfield network with multiple constraints

Abstract: The paper proposes an algorithm to solve the difficult problem of stereo correspondence in stereo vision. This problem can be considered as an optimization process or a constraint satisfaction process. It is found that in the course of the constraint satisfaction process, the more constraints the cost function specifies, the more accurate the result will be. The authors propose a similarity constraint coupled with the uniqueness, smoothing, ordering constraints to formulate the energy function of a Hopfield network to perform the optimum task. Simulation results have verified the effectiveness of our approach.

Title: Stereo imaging using a camera with stereoscopic adapter

Abstract: The authors analyze the characteristics of the stereoscopic adapter, which is a cost-effective way to generate stereo video sequences with a camera. We also propose an efficient way to compensate for the inherent distortions. In general, stereo sequences can be captured using a pair of cameras but the resulting sequences tend to yield various well-known problems due to different characteristics of the pair of stereo cameras. Meanwhile, a camera with the stereoscopic adapter provides a natural way to capture and display stereoscopic video. It allows users to access all the functions built into the camera, e.g. zoom, auto-focus, auto-exposure, special effects, etc. The cost however is the reduced quality of the videos since the adapter allows capture of stereo video sequences in the field sequential format, i.e. left and right images in different scan lines, respectively. In addition, it generates size and color distortions due to the physical configuration of the mirror in the adapter. We analyze and compensate for such distortions to reduce possible errors in vision applications exploiting the stereo images. According to our preliminary study, the adapter with the proposed compensation scheme will pave the way for various low cost image based virtual reality applications at hand.

Title: Image quantization using Self-Splitting Competitive Learning

Abstract: We have developed a new, robust clustering algorithm, Self-Splitting Competitive Learning (SSCL). It has shown great abilities in detecting not only isolated clusters, but overlapped clusters, curves and spherical shells. We apply SSCL to quantization of color images. The clustering algorithm iteratively partitions the color space into natural clusters without a prior information on the number of clusters. The algorithm starts with only a single color prototype and adaptively splits it into multiple prototypes during the learning process based on a split validity measure. It is able to discover all natural groups; each is associated with a color prototype. The experimental results show remarkably better performance as compared to several other existing clustering algorithms.

Title: A psychovisually-based image quality evaluator for JPEG images

Abstract: We propose an algorithm for evaluating the quality of JPEG compressed images, called the psychovisually-based image quality evaluator (PIQE), which measures the severity of artifacts produced by JPEG compression. The PIQE evaluates the image quality using two psychovisually-based fidelity criteria: blockiness and similarity. The blockiness is an index that measures the patterned square artifact created as a by-product of the lossy DCT-based compression technique used by JPEG and MPEG. The similarity measures the perceivable detail remaining after compression. The blockiness and similarity are combined into a single PIQE index used to assess quality. The PIQE model is tuned by using subjective assessment results of five subjects on six sets of images. The results show that the PIQE model is most accurate in the compression range for which JPEG is most effective.

Title: Contrast enhancement based on divided histogram manipulation

Abstract: A novel histogram manipulation technique, which re-assigns pixels of three sub-images based on a divided histogram, is presented. We use k-means to obtain two cluster centroids from the input image histogram, and then two thresholds are deduced to divide the input image into three sub-images. After mathematical morphology, connected components are obtained from sub-images separately. The proposed novel histogram manipulation technique applies, separately, histogram equalization to the three sub-images that were obtained by decomposing the input image based on two thresholds in the original histogram.

Title: Fusion of rough set theoretic approximations and FCM for color image segmentation

Abstract: A new technique applying the fusion of rough set theoretic approximations and fuzzy C-means algorithm for color image segmentation is presented. The aim of the technique is to segment natural images with regions having gradual variations in color value. The technique extracts color information regarding the number of segments and the segments center values from the image itself through rough set theoretic approximations and presents it as input to FCM block for the soft evaluation of the segments. The performance of the algorithm has been evaluated on various natural and simulated images.

Title: /spl lambda/-connectedness: method and application

Abstract: Introduces a systematic approach, which we call a /spl lambda/-connectedness method, that can be applied to several real image processing problems, such as segmentation/classification, searching and data reconstruction. In this paper, we integrate previous research work into a network/graph-based system to build a unified framework for these processes. This technique is based on a graph G=(V,E) and an associated "potential function" /spl rho/ on the vertices of the graph. A measure C/sub /spl rho//(x,y) is defined for the /spl lambda/-connectedness on vertices x,y/spl isin/G with respect to /spl rho/. For a certain /spl lambda//spl isin/[0,1], x and y are said to be /spl lambda/-connected if C/sub /spl rho//(x,y)/spl ges//spl lambda/. If every pair of vertices are /spl lambda/-connected, then /spl rho/ is called /spl lambda/-connected on G. /spl lambda/-connectedness is a measure of continuity in discrete spaces or systems. In this paper, we introduce /spl lambda/-connected segmentation and /spl lambda/-connected fitting. The /spl lambda/-connected method can be viewed as a fuzzy system method, and it has a close relationship to rough sets. This method also has potential uses in network economics and resource management.

Title: Anisotropic diffusion for object segmentation

Abstract: We describe a method for object segmentation that uses a modified version of the anisotropic diffusion algorithm. The original anisotropic diffusion is performed in the original image, and it is not suitable for texture or noisy images. Our method achieves accurate object detection by using anisotropic diffusion in another 2D space whose size is the same as the processed image. This space is called energy space. The idea is simple. The energy will center on the pixels in the energy space corresponding to the edge pixels of the real image. It can simplify the original overly complex schemes to save computation time. The authors also propose a novel edge linking method by edge directional vector based on the energy space. By experimental evidence, our method can increase the noise tolerance.

Title: High quality image interpolation for color filter arrays

Abstract: We propose a color interpolation method using high order B-splines for a single-chip CCD (charge-coupled device). Single-chip digital cameras use a color filter array (CFA) and an interpolation method in order to reconstruct high quality images from sparsely sampled images. Frequently, single-chip digital cameras use the bilinear interpolation method due to the simple implementation and fast processing time. We have applied the interpolation algorithm using the cubic spline in order to obtain high quality images. Experiments show that the cubic spline interpolation method provides better performance than the bilinear interpolation method.

Title: Edge detection method insensitive to the light and shade variance in image

Abstract: The article is concerned with a novel edge detection method derived from a vision model that was proposed by the authors (T. Sakamoto and T. Kato, 1998; 1999). This model is quite sensitive to abrupt changes of the image contrast and has the unique characteristic of enhancing less contrasted regions and inhibiting relatively high and firm contrasted regions on the target image. Consequently, the proposed method is insensitive to and not so much affected by illumination variance (light and shade in image) in comparison with other conventional and known methods. The paper also shows that any differential operator can be combined with this model. The authors' proposed method can change the characteristics of target operators and enhance their abilities. These modified operators will be robust against illumination variance and detect objects in detail. The paper shows the capabilities of the proposed method by showing some examples of edge detection and making a comparison with other differential operators and their edge detection results.

Title: Irregular adaptative pyramid of agents for segmentation to interpretation of image

Abstract: The paper presents the main concepts of a machine vision architecture based on a hybrid and a fine granularity multiagent system, that encourages incremental design via modular and hierarchical structuring of knowledge and pattern recognition mechanisms. The objective is not optimality of the image segmentation/interpretation but rather reliability versus unforeseen observation. We then present a first implementation of the architecture that tends to validate the approach and also that shows up a physical distribution of computation.

Title: Segmentation of a text printed in Korean and English using structure information and character recognizers

Abstract: The purpose of the research presented is to segment a text image printed in both Korean and English into character images, utilizing the structure information in Korean and English characters, and using a Korean, English and mixed language character recognizer. The image cannot be separated by only using the width and height of a character because those of an English character are not constant, contrary to those of a Korean character. Therefore we first classify the image into Korean or English using the structure information in Korean and English characters. If it is determined as a Korean character, we segment it with the average width of Korean characters in the text lines. If it is determined as an English character, we segment it using a classical method to segment touching alphanumeric characters. If it cannot be determined, we find possible cut points using a vertical histogram and use the mixed language recognizer to determine the right cut point. Since our method first classifies a block into Korean or English, it can be run faster than the traditional method that cannot identify the language. Each classified block can be segmented more accurately because more specific knowledge about Korean and English characters can be applied.

Title: Managing processes of perceptual organization for emerging geometrical objects

Abstract: Three lower level layers of the hierarchical machine perception system are described, and experimental results are provided. The system is based on agile camera and aimed at automatic recognition of simple geometric scenes, made of crafted manipulation objects. The primary process of grouping the edgelets on the image is described. Two methods of edgelet grouping are compared, namely a Hough transform based method and a method based on LSR. Some modifications to both methods have been proposed. Next, a process of perceptual grouping of elementary features, short segments, is described. Three approaches to feature fusion are addressed: one based on crisp, geometrical, heuristic conditions, the second based on fuzzified conditions and the third one based on Dempster-Shafer theory. The results obtained with the three methods are compared and presented on the example image of a real scene. Higher layer issues, namely a problem of contour closing and of separating particular objects (in the case of occlusions) are briefly discussed. Some preliminary results in that area are reported.

Title: Statistically constrained snake deformations

Abstract: The authors present a method for constraining the deformations of Snakes (active contour models) when segmenting a known class of objects. The method we propose is similar to both active shape models (ASM) but without the landmark identification and correspondence requirement, and to active contour models (ACM), but armed with a priori information about shape variation. Rather than representing the object boundary by spatial landmarks in a point-by-point fashion, we employ a frequency based boundary representation. In this way, the principal component analysis (PCA), which is central to ASM, is applied to a set of frequency-domain shape descriptors, removing the need for the difficult determination of spatial landmarks. Given a training set of representative images of the object of interest, we extract an average object shape along with a set of significant shape variation modes, explaining most of the shape variation in the training set. Armed with this a priori model of shape variation, we find the boundaries in unknown images by placing an initial ACM and allowing it to deform only according to the examined shape variations. The described methodology was applied to a set of 105 echocardiographic images for locating the left ventricular boundary. The results were particularly encouraging in clinically difficult cases where the ventricular boundary was partly occluded by noise.

Title: An efficient extraction of character string positions using morphological operator

Abstract: An efficient extraction of character string positions in a document is proposed by using a morphological operator. In regions of character strings, axial edge pixels and diagonal edge pixels are mingled together, but in other regions, they are distributed separately. Based on this difference in the directional edge pixel distribution between the character and the non-character regions, string positions are extracted directly from arbitrary blocks without any block analysis, in contrast to previous work which requires block analysis to extract string positions (F.M. Wahl et al., 1982; S. Imade et al., 1993). Experiments are conducted on the document images acquired through the scanner, and the proposed method can directly extract the character string positions from the plain text of character blocks, and even from the document containing tables and flow-charts, without any block analysis.

Title: Cell detection and tracking for micromanipulation vision system of cell-operation robot

Abstract: The paper discusses cell detection and tracking in a microscope scene for a cell-operation robot. An approach integrating a morphological operator and Bayesian estimation technique is used for cell detection and tracking. One of the problems in the implementation is difficulty in obtaining accurate information of cells. We introduce classification criteria which rely on both shape and texture information of the cell to get fine results, and we present geometric constraints incorporating a nonlinear diffusion process to reduce the drift of points during the tracking procedure. A preliminary test is conducted on the system. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Title: Fuzzy-probabilistic object recognition based on edge and texture descriptors fusion

Abstract: A great deal of research effort has been devoted to information processing in pattern recognition. It has been established that when it comes to making decisions upon the perceptual content of the information there is no case-independent and commonly approved technique. This is in part due to the complexity of the real world information to the measurements' ambiguity or the observer's imperfect knowledge, but mostly, to the non-integrity of the available information. Fusing many knowledge sources is a recent trend in the pattern recognition field. Fuzzy logic provides a general conceptual framework and an analytical tool as well. Fusion and fuzzy uncertain modelling of salient image features such as edges and texture are at the core of the proposed method.

Title: Bilateral functions of direction and pattern by auto-correlation model-categorizing texture and office images

Abstract: It is known that visual functions such as color, direction, and movement are specialized in the brain. However, it is not clear how the functions are detected. We introduce an auto-correlation model to detect direction parameters. The paper examines how important pattern is as a visual function and how it is detected. We apply an auto-correlation model because direction is based on continuity, while pattern is based on discontinuity. We therefore hypothesize that pattern is an opposite function against direction. Pattern (in the article), means a repetition of different areas, which has a property of discontinuity. We conclude that the auto-correlation model proposed detects not only edge and line directions but also patterns, repetitions of different areas in images, and is useful for discriminating texture images by material and retrieve images by words, which are supported by experiments.

Title: Super-resolution enhancement of night vision image sequences

Abstract: In several recent movie blockbusters, including Enemy of the State and Patriot Games, scientists magnify digital satellite imagery to determine the identities of people captured on surveillance video. These individuals appear rather blocky at the coarsest resolution scales due to undersampling by the image sensor array, but they become remarkably clear after zooming in on a particular region-of-interest. Obviously, real-world video enhancement algorithms are simply not capable of calculating the perfect results produced in Hollywood. However, additional detail can be extracted from an image sequence by integrating several adjacent digital video frames to compute a high-resolution video still. Extensive prior research has been conducted on the Bayesian super-resolution enhancement of visible light image sequences. For night vision applications, super-resolution enhancement must be applied to image sequences with frames acquired in the infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum. Most of these applications are DoD-related (military), and they include the enhancement of infrared reconnaissance and surveillance imagery, as well as the enhancement of infrared imagery for automated target tracking and real time multisensor fusion. Several computational simulations have been performed, which visually depict how well the proposed technique enhances short night vision image sequences consisting of two-to-five frames This technique is capable of increasing resolution by factors up to 16/spl times/, although video stills appear somewhat blocky at higher magnification factors.

Title: Contour following parallel thinning for simple binary images

Abstract: Thinning is a process of reducing the width of an image to just a single pixel. The resulting thinned pattern is useful for topological analysis and classification for the shape of patterns containing elongated or line-like parts such as printed or handwritten characters. Some existing well-known thinning algorithms were studied. Based on the information obtained from the study, we designed and implemented a new thinning algorithm known as CFPTA. The algorithm uses contour following parallel processing and a lookup table for the determination of pixel deletion. The processing time of CFPTA is fast in general. Although the skeletons generated are not perfect, edges are shortened, and all other characters of the images are preserved. This is adequate for applications of simple binary images such as character recognition.

Title: Topology-adaptive modeling of objects by using variable-size ball marching

Abstract: The paper proposes a novel method of modeling multiobject scenes or objects of arbitrary topology by a marching method based on mathematical morphology operations with a variable-size structuring element. We assume that 3D data on the whole object surface has been acquired. A narrow-band stopping region is built by merging the neighborhood of every data point. A single close-surface surrounding the data point set is given as an initial shape. The surface shrinks and splits smoothly by repeated erosions with a ball structuring element, whose size increases continuously as the curvature of the surface increases. Every surface point stops moving if it lies in the stopping region. After this surface fitting to the stopping region, the region is narrowed, and the fitting-and-narrowing cycle is repeated until the model is consistent with the object surface on the basis of a topological check. After the above rough estimation, for model refinement, we extract a quadrangular mesh from the resultant surface, and then perform precise fitting to the 3D data by using an energy minimisation.

Title: A new reasoning based filter

Abstract: A novel fuzzy filter is proposed. As recent studies show (Y. Choi and R. Krishnapuram, 1997), developing a rule based system capable of addressing all the different issues in filtering seems to be a tedious task and requires a large rule base. But nevertheless, if we can transform the features (such as amplitude, location and/or time index) into a higher dimension feature space, we can have a data set with more separation between "noisy" and "clean" signals. Therefore, the decision boundaries would be mathematically less complicated, and consequently a smaller number of rules is needed.

Title: Holonic self-organization of multi-agent systems by fuzzy modeling with application to intelligent manufacturing

Abstract: Holonic manufacturing aims to design standardized, modular manufacturing systems made of interchangeable parts, to enable flexibility, online reconfigurability and self-organizing capabilities for the production systems. Recent advances in distributed artificial intelligence and networking technologies have proven that theoretical multi-agent systems (MAS) concepts are very suitable for the real life implementation of holonic concepts. Building on our recent results in the design and implementation of holonic reconfigurable architectures, the paper introduces a novel approach to the online self-organization of distributed systems. By using fuzzy set and uncertainty theoretical concepts, we construct a mathematical foundation for modeling MAS, where appropriate holonic structures are identified for each particular application. This approach opens new possibilities for the design of any distributed system that needs self-organization as an intrinsic property.

Title: Gaze control on virtual active vision system with binocular fish-eye lenses

Abstract: A human continuously directs his eyes toward interesting points to recognize an object. Such eye movement or visual attention plays an important role in human vision. To simulate such eye movements, the paper proposes a virtual active vision head with binocular fish-eye lenses. Moving objects are detected within the wide angle of view obtained through the fish-eye lens by comparing the input image with the background image estimated by an adaptive M-estimator. The location of the moving object is used as a visual cue to achieve the saccadic eye movement. The proposed virtual active vision system was implemented on a PC cluster. Two PCs are used to capture images through the left and right fish-eye lenses and a PC with four processors is used for image processing. Real time gaze control is achieved on the proposed virtual binocular active vision system.

Title: Evaluating machine agent coupling of reactive and planning-based control architectures for manufacturing

Abstract: The paper focuses on investigations into the relative performance of reactive and planning based control architectures with a focus on the control system performance and the notion of meta-control (i.e., the use of control architecture performance data to advise on the best architecture for given performance objectives). The work is intended to provide insights into why partial hierarchies of decision makers (i.e., planning based architectures) perform better than pure heterarchies of decision makers (i.e., reactive architectures) and how this information can be used in a dynamically evolving control architecture such as a holonic manufacturing system.

Title: Comparison of hierarchical and holonic shop floor control using a virtual manufacturing environment

Abstract: Shop floor control is typically implemented with a centralized supervisory control system. Holonic control, a form of distributed control, provides a more robust control environment and improves production performance. The authors create a 3D virtual manufacturing environment to compare hierarchical control with holonic control. We use this virtual environment to analyze alternative approaches and quantify their effects on the system behavior in a controlled environment. Finally, we present a measure of robustness derived from reliability theory and utilize it for comparisons.

Title: Negotiation protocol for proof of realization of cooperative task in multi-agent robot systems

Abstract: The authors propose a negotiation protocol for verifying the feasibility of a cooperative task. In our multiagent system, each agent has a knowledge base to make plans and prove the feasibility of the requested task. When a task request is received by an agent, the agent asks its own knowledge base whether the task is executable or not. If the agent recognizes that it needs another agent's cooperation to execute the task, the agent requests other agents to verify whether the cooperation is acceptable. Using this protocol in a multiagent system that consists of heterogeneous agents, these agents verify the feasibility of a chain of cooperative tasks. In this framework, we design a multiagent system that consists of mobile robots, manipulators, camera robots and several sensors. We also perform complex tasks such as printing and delivering documents, and demonstrate the applicability of our proposal.

Title: Development of reusable, configurable, extensible holonic manufacturing system

Abstract: Modern manufacturing system have to deal with dynamic situations such as customer specification changes, machine break-down, emergency orders and other kinds of disturbances. This requires the manufacturing system to be adaptive to handle such situations. The holonic concept has been proposed as an efficient paradigm for developing such an adaptive manufacturing system. There are still some critical issues to be investigated such as how to define the holons for a given application context and make them reusable, what should be an appropriate system architecture and how to design the system cooperation mechanisms for better system performance. The Intelligent Machine Architecture (IMA) is a software architecture developed at Vanderbilt University. It provides a framework for developing reusable components and constructing reconfigurable, extensible systems. Although it is mainly used for robots, it is also a suitable development tool for designing adaptive manufacturing systems. The authors explain how to build reusable, reconfigurable and extensible holonic manufacturing systems based on the IMA framework.

Title: A hybrid PC/PLC architecture for manufacturing system control-implementation

Abstract: The paper presents a novel and generic PC/PLC-based software/hardware architecture for the control of flexible manufacturing workcells. The proposed implementation methodology is based on the utilization of any one of the available formal discrete-event-system control theories in conjunction with state-of-the-art industrial programmable-logic controllers (PLCs). The specific control theory used is a combination of extended Moore automata and Ramadge-Wonham automata that has been developed by our research group. The modular control software architecture has been developed for MS-Windows environments. The effective graphical user interface provides a transparent programming environment.

Title: Specification and synthesis of control software for flexible manufacturing systems

Abstract: The paper deals with automated task programming of flexible manufacturing systems (FMS). The method presented allows a) to progressively specify the operations to be performed in an FMS and b) to automatically synthesize the core of highly concurrent control software. During the specification phase tasks are modeled as Petri net modules; the analysis of properties is performed in each step of the design process. During the synthesis phase the tasks are defined and the mechanisms of communication, synchronization and mutual exclusion are built into the pertinent task bodies. This technique is presented and illustrated through an example where Ada code is generated.

Title: Architecture and design of a holonic visual interface

Abstract: The holonic visual interface is an intelligent agent-based interface for the human visualisation of holonic systems and for their control. Such visual interfaces must also be appropriate for inter-human co-ordination. This is a human-system distributed interface which facilitates integrated collaboration between humans and systems. These interfaces need to be utilizable at many levels of a manufacturing or other distributed agent-based system, operating concurrently.

Title: Holonic manufacturing system for distributed control of automated guided vehicles

Abstract: Automated guided vehicle (AGV) systems traditionally utilize a central controller to assign transportation tasks among vehicles. Because of its rigidity, a centralized architecture may not suitable for modern manufacturing with its rapidly changing markets, demands for products with higher quality, smaller batch sizes, customer specifications, and shorter delivery times. This research applies concepts from holonic manufacturing systems to develop a distributed AGV control system that is flexible and robust in the presence of disturbances. We present the architecture of the holonic manufacturing system, a coordination strategy based on contract nets, and simulation results that indicate an improvement in utilization when compared with traditional centralized control.

Title: Architecture of the multi-agent system as a collaboration of physical devices

Abstract: We describe the architecture of a multi-agent system for collaboration of physical devices. A major characteristic of a multi-agent system is collaboration among agents to achieve hierarchical tasks and services. Many multi-agent systems have been proposed, and some of these are used for practical problems. In our target environment, where there are many physical devices such as robots or sensors, many difficulties have occurred because of the physical constraints or changes of the environment. We present an architecture for such a situation and the library named Java Multi Agent Component (JMAC) implemented using a network and the Java object-oriented language to deal with these problems.

Title: Design of virtual production lines in back-end semiconductor manufacturing systems

Abstract: Due to the mammoth needs of the semiconductor market, semiconductor manufacturing systems have been given special attention. Their operations require a manufacturing execution system (MES) that functions as the representative of an enterprise resource planner on the shop floor. However, MES integration with a shop-floor control system, while guaranteeing system agility, is difficult to implement. The paper introduces the concept of virtual production lines (VPL) as a solution to this implementation. A methodology is proposed to facilitate the VPL design, which dynamically configures a large system into many production lines according to system status, guarantees the line balance and efficiency, and predicates the completion time of each group of products accurately. The proposed methodology and algorithms are demonstrated through a simplified back-end semiconductor manufacturing system.

Title: Internal communication architecture for resource holons

Abstract: Key aspects of holonic manufacturing systems (HMS) are flexibility and reconfigurability in view of change and disturbances. Disturbances may occur due to malfunction of the machinery equipment; changes in the manufacturing environment may require new holonic control algorithms to be adopted. We present an architectural approach supporting dynamic reconfiguration of resource holons in case of malfunction and recovery. For flexible and efficient testing and validation of holonic control algorithms the proposed communication architecture supports the connection of high-level holonic control logic to manufacturing machinery as well as to emulations of the machinery.

Title: On-line estimation of key quality parameters in nonwoven production

Abstract: In an industrial nonwoven production process, data related to spun-web quality including firmness, thickness, and weight are measured online. However, these measurements provide insufficient information about the spun-web quality. As a result, other parameters that give a better insight into the quality of the product have been employed. One of these parameters reveals the minimum force necessary to pull apart a given size of piece of spun-web. It is measured in a quality control laboratory by stretching the ends of a sample piece of spun-web to a high degree of tension. Since the laboratory measurements are infrequent and off-line, an on-line monitoring of product quality can hardly be carried out. Neural network-based virtual sensors are developed based on historical data that incorporate both online and off-line measurements. The virtual sensors provide estimates of key quality parameters at the measurement frequency of the on-line measurements. They are implemented at a production facility of Freudenberg Nonwovens KG in Germany and have been successfully employed for on-line quality monitoring.

Title: An Internet-based remote assembling system

Abstract: The paper proposes a concept for a next generation manufacturing system, which is globally distributed rather than geographically limited. This new manufacturing system is possible because of recent changes in manufacturing technology. To work as a global unit, companies need to work closely together to improve efficiency by sharing resources, experts, tools, and training. To support these collaborative works, an Internet-based remote assembling system (RAS) is proposed. This system is remotely controlled through the Internet to allow an operator at a remote location to operate resources at an assembling workcell. For example, a Web browser connects the operator to the Web server at the assembling workcell to download an Internet-based design application, allowing the operator to select the product that needs to be assembled. After the selection, a command to assemble the product is created and sent to the assembling workcell. Along with this concept, preliminary results based on simulation are shown.

Title: Die temperature monitoring of high pressure die casting

Abstract: The high pressure die casting (HPDC) process is normally referred to as the cold chamber process which solves the materials problem by separating the molten metal reservoir from the actuator for most of the process cycle. In this process, the thermal effects of molten metal flow in the die are a major factor in determining casting surface quality, die life, and many internal quality parameters such as porosity. Therefore, development of an effective technology to promptly evaluate the effect of changes in thermal process variables is vital to the quality control and improvement of productivity. Image processing technology has been applied to analyse the thermal images. The information is correlated to thermal energy stored in the die to develop a thermal control system and improve the quality of castings.

Title: Modeling of machining using relationships between features

Abstract: Integration of engineering activities in advanced, intelligent computing assisted environments constitutes one of the most active research interests in engineering modeling. This is because high level modeling techniques are required and these techniques must be suitable for integration in comprehensive product models. Existing application oriented master model concepts and standards such as STEP can serve this purpose. However, some important models and their relationships with other models have not been made available. One of these is a model of the machining process of mechanical parts that is associative with all of the related models in a comprehensive product model. The authors propose a model that offers full associativity with form feature based part models so that creation of part models can be done simultaneously with the analysis of machinability. The authors refused earlier solutions as the application of separate design and machining features and proposed the application of a second associative reordered feature sequence for machining purposes. Then the fusion or split of the listed shape modifications are applied to fulfil the demands of the machining process. An introduction of the feature based concepts is followed by an outline of the applied modeling method. Following this the creation and handling of Petri net model representations are detailed. After a discussion of the application of the results, the main characteristics of the modeling are concluded.

Title: A method for solving large-scale flowshop problems by reducing search space of genetic algorithms

Abstract: It is important to force search algorithms in promising regions of the solution space when solving large-scale problems. Genetic algorithms with search space reduction are proposed to solve flowshop problems. Additional precedence constraints generated by heuristic rules are introduced to reduce the search space of the genetic algorithm. An improved crossover operator which preserves the constraints is proposed and compared with other standard crossover operators. The computation results show that the algorithm has a significant improvement as compared with the standard genetic algorithms.

Title: Deadlock-free scheduling method for track systems in semiconductor fabrication

Abstract: This paper addresses a deadlock-free scheduling method for track systems in semiconductor fabrication. A track system is clustered equipment performing the photolithography process in semiconductor fabrication. Trends toward high automation and flexibility in the track systems accelerate the necessity of the intelligent scheduler that can guarantee reliability and optimize productivity of the track systems. We propose an efficient deadlock-free scheduling method that can avoid deadlock inherent to track systems and optimize the productivity. We employ two procedures for the deadlock-free scheduling. First, we define the potential deadlock set and deadlock-safe set to apply the deadlock avoidance policy efficiently. After introducing the potential deadlock set and the deadlock-safe set we propose a deadlock avoidance policy using an online Gantt chart, which can generate optimal or near-optimal schedules without deadlock. The proposed deadlock-free scheduling method is shown to be efficient in handling deadlock inherent to the track systems through simulation.

Title: Conflict management in an intelligent multiagent robotic system

Abstract: The paper presents a methodology and methods that allows a robotic system comprised of intelligent robotic agents to coordinate and negotiate their actions in order to achieve common goals. Each individual robotic agent consists of several autonomous components of its control system that allow the agent to perceive and react to its environment, to plan and execute an action, and to negotiate with other agents in an intelligent manner. Particular emphasis is placed on the negotiation and coordination process between two conflicting agents. Here, the workspace shared by both agents is treated as a common resource, and the coordination problem becomes a resource allocation problem. Strategies for conflict prevention and compromise strategies are presented in detail and implemented in a simulation.

Title: Adaptive filters for the suppression of tremor

Abstract: Intention tremor severely compromises everyday life tasks in patients suffering with multiple sclerosis or Parkinson's disease. The paper reports the current achievements in the analysis of subjects' movements. The trajectories produced by patients affected by tremor are investigated. Indexing procedures for the evaluation of the tremor which is present in the trajectories are proposed. Such indexes should be sensitive to tremor while they are not to ordinary movements. The properties of the indexes have been verified both with analytical considerations and with numerical tests. An experimental setup has been realized for the analysis of tremor on patients affected by multiple sclerosis tremor. The data collected within this experiment have been compared with expected results. Furthermore the indexing procedure has been applied for the evaluation of a filtering system. The case of handwriting has been chosen as the reference task for the evaluation of achieved results. The results of clinical tests are presented. Finally the applicability of the index-based procedures to the control of filtering systems is discussed. The control architectures in the case of force-feedback less interfaces as well as haptic interfaces are presented and discussed.

Title: Visual servoing for human-robot interaction in the wheelchair-based rehabilitation robot

Abstract: We provide an introduction to the overall structure of a new wheelchair-based robotic arm system, KARES II, and its human-robot interaction technologies which assist independent life of the elderly and the disabled that have disadvantages in sensory and motor functions of their limbs. First of all, the tasks of a robotic arm are specified. Next, several human-robot interaction technologies are presented to perform the defined tasks in comfortable and safe ways. In addition, the input/output relation of several interaction technologies, such as an eye-mouse, a haptic suit, bio-signal recognition and visual servoing, is described under two essential factors: one is intention reading of the user, and the other is the autonomous capability of the robot. Among those technologies, we concentrate on visual servoing that is a good solution for reducing the burden of a user in a wheelchair with a robotic arm. We mention difficulties of visual servoing in the wheelchair-based robotic arm. It is found that visual servoing using space variant vision has several merits in an eye-in-hand configuration. Specially, a nearby target is handled efficiently through a modified log-polar mapping.

Title: Reengineering the operator interface for a semiconductor manufacturing execution system

Abstract: Dominion Semiconductor (DSC) manufactures state-of-the-art computer memory devices. DSC uses a commercial software system called the SiView manufacturing execution system (MES) to manage all aspects of the production process. Originally designed in the early 1980s, the SiView user interface suffers shortcomings typical of legacy systems. These include screens that are unattractive and difficult to read, screen content that is not interactive, and screen-to-screen flow that is inefficient. We describe a student project that designed a prototype for a new SiView operator interface (OPI). The new design is based on a thorough analysis of SiView's structure and functionality, repeated on-site observation and interviews with DSC engineers and operators at work in the clean-room environment, and an extensive review of current research on graphical user interface (GUI) design. The prototype illustrates the migration from text-based to windows-based screens, which makes the interface easier to read and navigate. Additionally, screen flow is rationalized, which improves access to the most frequently used screens and makes the interface consistent with the way Dominion operators actually perform tasks. Benefits of the prototype include enhanced operator satisfaction, improved efficiency, quicker learning time, and reduced calls to the help desk.

Title: Integrated visual servoing system to grasp industrial parts moving on conveyer by controlling 6DOF arm

Abstract: The paper describes an integrated visual servoing system able to track and grasp industrial parts moving on a conveyer by controlling a 6-DOF robot arm. Using a real-time image based visual servoing method, the fully-6-DOF robot arm is controlled by PC-based vision and robot controllers. The hybrid Kalman filter is incorporated into both controllers in order to track a moving object stably against visual data noise. A teaching method for grasping the moving objects is also proposed which leads to simplification of teaching tasks. Experimental results prove that the practical conveyer-tracking and grasping tasks in manufacturing can be realized with our integrated visual servoing system.

Title: Patient care management using a multi-agent approach

Abstract: Patient management and medical decision making involves collaboration between a number of health professionals such as nurses, laboratory analysts, general practitioners, specialist consultants and the patients. This is particularly true for chronic diseases where the follow up takes place over a long period of time involving a number of people. We present our ongoing research effort in the application of multi-agent systems to support patient care management through effective collaboration between health professionals. We present a conceptual model of our approach and then describe a prototype system for diabetic patient care management that has been implemented using the Java Agent Development Environment (JADE).

Title: Monitoring of breath sound under daily environment by ceiling dome microphone

Abstract: This paper proposes a new method for monitoring normal breath sounds in a daily environment where many kinds of noises exist. In a typical conventional breath monitor, a thermistor, an accelerometer, or a contact-type microphone must be attached directly to a person's body such as a part around the nose and the mouth, or a part over the chest wall and the trachea. This paper focuses on key issues stemming from a factor of the environment: extraction of breath sounds from sensor signals contaminated by environmental noise; and realization of a monitoring system suitable for our homes. Features of normal breath sounds are clarified by frequency analysis. Based on the features, a method for extracting normal breath sounds is discussed. This paper also describes a ceiling dome microphone which is a kind of a parabolic sound concentrator. It realizes a function of detecting normal breathing sounds with high sensitivity while keeping a room's appearance natural. The gain obtained by such a concentrator is analyzed theoretically from the acoustic point of view. Experimental results proved the feasibility of the proposed method.

Title: An automated real-time direction-sensitive motion detection system

Abstract: An image processing system is presented that is aimed specifically at helping airport security guards detect passengers entering a concourse through the egress passageway. Motion detection is achieved through grayscale image differencing between reference and current images that have a mosaic substructure. Motion analysis and prediction are performed using predictor templates, and are primarily controlled by a rule-based system that alternates between updating motion activity and motion prediction mosaic images. The detection system is very resistant to false alarms produced by moving shadows and more trivial motions like arm swinging. The system has enough speed and sensitivity to detect small objects, such as a handgun or small package (presumably enclosing a weapon or bomb), thrown across the camera's field of view. The system also contains enough robustness to detect a human moving the wrong way in a dense crowd of right-way travellers.

Title: A multi-level reconfiguration control for holonic PLC

Abstract: The system architecture for a holonic PLC (HPLC) is presented and the multi-level reconfiguration control mechanism for a function block (FB)-based PLC is detailed. Based on IEC-1499 FB model concepts, the concurrent process mechanism for FB configuration control and FB process control is put forward. In the presented approach, the dynamic reconfiguration control of the HPLC is handled at three control levels: function, component, and task control. Separating configuration control at the component level from task level facilitates a code-based component maintenance and task state transition process. It can carry out on-the-fly control for the HPLC by means of task level operation and smooth state transition cooperating with associated class maintenance under the limited capability of object oriented class dynamic configuration.

Title: Preliminary evaluation of global hand function measurement device

Abstract: This paper presents initial results from the evaluation of a new virtual reality, force feedback device for measurement of global hand function. In particular, this paper describes the software developed to better support the collection, transformation and display of hand data from the device hardware, and it also describes the initial testing of the device using the improved software interface. The raw vector information provided by the device is of only limited use in understanding the hand motion being measured. By transforming and incorporating the vector data into an articulated 3-D structure using the Open Graphics Library standard, a crude but useable graphical model of the hand and its movements has been developed. Several options are available for manipulation of the model, including camera positioning, lighting, emphasis effects, and digit segment rotation estimates. Studies with the device revealed several hardware constraints that prevent comprehensive data analysis and force feedback. However, the software was shown to be an effective way to quantify and visualize the movements of the human hand. Future work will include retrieval and display of movement rates and forces, as well as a more realistic display of the hand.

Title: An intelligent above-knee prosthesis with EMG-based terrain identification

Abstract: Gait analyses show that knee moments are considerably different when walking on different terrain. To accommodate changing conditions, prostheses should provide a means for adjusting the knee moments by identifying conditions of the terrain. In this research, terrain identification is obtained by the use of electromyographic (EMG) signals that are used to control resistive moments of an above-knee prosthesis. Results from laboratory experiments demonstrate that the technique is effective for identification and adaptable to different terrain.

Abstract: The objective is to propose an immune distributed competitive problem solver using MHC and an immune network and to verify its validity by means of computer simulations. Our algorithm solves the division-of-labor issues and problems for each agent work domain in a multi-agent system (MPS) by two immune functions. First, the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) distinguishes "self" from "nonself", used in the process of eliminating states of competition. Second, the immune network that produces specific antibodies by modification of immune cells is used to produce adaptive behaviors for agents. Then, to investigate the validity of the proposed method, this algorithm is applied to the "N-th agent travelling salesmen problem (n-TSP)" as a typical case problem for multi-agent systems. The effectiveness of solving multi-agent system problems in this way is clarified through some simulations.

Title: Non-restricted measurement of walking distance

Abstract: Vertical walking distance is discussed. The horizontal distance is estimated by using the three dimensional acceleration of the subject's toe. Considering the movement of the foot, it is assumed that only the pitch angle of the foot changes and that the velocity of the foot is never negative. A three dimensional accelerometer is fixed to the subject's toe and measures the acceleration during the swing phase of the foot. A piezoelectric gyro is used to estimate the angle of the foot and to calculate its horizontal acceleration. The horizontal distance is obtained by integrating the horizontal acceleration twice each step. The vertical distance is calculated by integrating the change of atmospheric pressure during ascent or descent. A band pass filter is applied to reject natural changes of the atmospheric pressure and sensor noise. The integration of the output of the filter produces a value corresponding to the vertical distance. Experiments were performed in a horizontal corridor and on some stairs. The results show that the error of the horizontal distance estimated is less than 5.3% and 0.0% on average, and the vertical distance is less than 11.1%.

Title: Analysis of fundamental frequency for near term suicidal risk assessment

Abstract: Among the many clinical decisions that psychiatrists must make, assessment of a patient's risk of committing suicide is definitely among the most important, complex and demanding. Clinical experience has shown that successful predictions of suicidality were often based on the patient's voice independent of content. Vocal patterns associated with dynamic expressiveness were designated as one of the most distinguishable features in the voices of suicidal patients at imminent risk. This paper investigates this phenomenon in an effort to explore the discriminating ability of jitter (period-to-period fluctuations in fundamental frequency) among suicidal and nonsuicidal patients. First, a wavelet transform based glottal cycle duration estimation technique is employed for the voiced/unvoiced decision and fundamental frequency (F0) estimation. Second, F0 perturbations are computed for each voiced segment in the F0 contour. Statistical analyses showed that F0 perturbations differ significantly (p=0.0069) between suicidal and nonsuicidal subjects' speech. Finally, a maximum likelihood classifier was developed, which obtained a correct classification score of 80%.

Title: Expanding the meaning of and applications for data mining

Abstract: Summary form only. Data mining in databases aims to make sense of data by revealing meaningful and easily interpretable relationships. In spite of many existing variations, this research goal permeates the entire area. The domain of data mining is highly heterogeneous embracing a number of well-established information technologies including: statistical pattern recognition, neural networks, machine learning, knowledge-based systems, etc. The synergistic character of data mining is one of its dominant features that makes this pursuit an emerging new area of research and application. By its nature, data mining is very much oriented towards the end-user, thus implying that any results need to be easily interpretable. Granulation of information promotes this interpretability and channels pursuits of data mining, which can be computationally intensive and thus highly prohibitive, towards more efficient and feasible processing of information granules. Finally, an interesting emerging area of data mining involves perception. Data mining often retrieves "perceived data" and the problem is to reconcile this perceived data with the real world. Information granulation can help with this problem.

Title: A novel self-optimizing approach for knowledge acquisition

Abstract: Attribute reduction and rule generation (attribute value reduction) are two of the main processes of knowledge acquisition. A self-optimizing approach based on a difference comparison table for knowledge acquisition for these processes is proposed. For the attribute reduction process, conventional logic computation was replaced by matrix computation with some added concepts from evolutionary computation and used to construct the self-adaptive optimizing algorithm. In addition, some sub-algorithms and proofs are presented in detail. For the rule generation process, a value orderly reduction algorithm, which simplifies the complexity of rule knowledge, is presented. The approach provides an effective and efficient method for knowledge acquisition, which is supported by the experimentation.

Title: The relationship between artificial intelligence and data mining: application to future military information systems

Abstract: This paper describes the relationship between data mining (DM) and artificial intelligence (AI) and how both can improve future military information systems. As these information systems take advantage of the technology trends, they will derive their upgrades from expert systems, knowledge-bases (KBs), inference engines, robotics, natural language, remote sensing, knowledge discovery (KD), and data mining over networks. This will result in an expansion to all echelons of present capabilities that now are available to warfighters only at the higher echelons. Moreover, it will result in an improved battlefield awareness for all warfighters beyond anything that is implemented today.

Title: A parallel decision tree builder for mining very large visualization datasets

Abstract: Simulation problems in the DOE ASCI program generate visualization datasets more than a terabyte in size. The practical difficulties in visualizing such datasets motivate the desire for automatic recognition of salient events. We have developed a parallel decision tree classifier for use in this context. Comparisons to ScalParC, a previous attempt to build a fast parallelization of a decision tree classifier, are provided. Our parallel classifier executes on the "ASCI Red" supercomputer. Experiments demonstrate that datasets too large to be processed on a single processor can be efficiently handled in parallel, and suggest that there need not be any decrease in accuracy relative to a monolithic classifier constructed on a single processor.

Title: A fast distributed mining algorithm for association rules with item constraints

Abstract: Association rule mining is an important task of data mining. In practice, being often interested in a subset of association rules, users only want to get rules that contain a specific item. Integrating the item constraints into the mining process can acquire more efficient algorithms. This paper addresses the problem of distributed mining association rules with item constraints which are formalized Boolean expressions, and presents a fast algorithm called DMCA. Principles and implementation of the algorithm are discussed. Experiments prove efficiency of the algorithm.

A feature selection technique using genetic algorithms is applied. For classification, hard and fuzzy kNN classifiers are compared. Composite Fuzzy classifier architectures are investigated. Experiments are conducted on AVIRIS data, and the results are evaluated in the paper.

Title: Effectiveness of ordinal information for data mining

Abstract: During the last decade the technologies for generating and collecting data have advanced rapidly. As a result, the problem now is not the obtaining of data but the techniques, able to analyze large volumes of data and to produce meaningful and useful information. One of the most popular data mining tasks is that of classification. Though data mining is oriented to analyzing large volumes of data of different nature (quantitative as well as qualitative ones), additional knowledge about dependencies among all elements of these data sets may change the results of the analysis from failure to success. In some classification tasks classes and attribute values are connected in an ordinal way. We show that if we take into account ordinal dependencies among data elements, we may produce much more manageable and meaningful results.

Title: Mining fuzzy association rules with weighted items

Abstract: In most models of mining fuzzy association rules, the items are considered to have equal importance. Due to diverse human interest and preference for items, such models do not work well in many situations. To improve such models, we propose a method to mine fuzzy association rules with weighted items. One of the major problems in data mining research is the development of good measures of interest of discovered rules. The weighted support and weighted confidence for fuzzy association rules are defined. Kohonen self-organized mapping is used to fuzzify the numerical attributes into linguistic terms. A new fuzzy association rule mining algorithm, which generalizes the popular Apriori Gen large itemset based algorithm, is developed. The advantages of the new algorithm are shown by testing it on a census database with 5000 transaction records.

Title: Constructing a fuzzy expert system using the ILFN network and the genetic algorithm

Abstract: A method for automatic construction of a fuzzy expert system from numerical data using the ILFN network and a genetic algorithm is presented. The incremental learning fuzzy neural (ILFN) network was developed for pattern classification problems. The ILFN network is a fast, one-pass, on-line, and incremental learning algorithm. A knowledge base for fuzzy expert systems is extracted from the hidden units of the ILFN classifier. The genetic algorithm is then used, in an iterative manner, to reduce the number of rules and select important input pattern features needed to generate a comprehensible fuzzy rule-based system.

Title: Parallel data mining for pharmacophore discovery

Abstract: Rapid and effective design of new drugs to combat new strains of antibiotic resistant organisms, more effectively treat chronic conditions, and provide other life sustaining treatment is a key challenge for the medical industry. Current drug design methodologies can take several years just in the initial chemical evaluation stages before compounds can be created for animal and human testing. This paper presents some recent research results in a new parallel machine learning approach that can expedite the drug design cycle. An inductive logic programming search has been reformulated and parallelized to run on an eight node Beowulf cluster. Initial testing with several data sets indicate almost linear speedup using the cluster.

Title: A precise classifier for the substances in urinary sediment images based on neural networks and fuzzy reasoning

Abstract: A new method is proposed to classify the substances in urinary sediment images based on the combination of neural networks and fuzzy reasoning. First, the features of the normal substance for each one are collected. Second, based on these features, each kind of normal substance can be classified from all substances in the urinary sediment images by using the BP-NN. One structure of the NN is designed for each substance and all of them are trained separately. After that, if abnormal substances cannot be separated properly by NN, they are classified further by using fuzzy reasoning. A database is created for storing the different types of substances which include normal and abnormal substances used as standard patterns. Then the similarity degrees between the standard patterns and tested substances are calculated. Furthermore, other features such as the texture are used for creating an "If-then" knowledge base based on the experiences of expert. Finally, the knowledge base for each substance is applied to evaluate the abnormal substance by using fuzzy reasoning. As a result, the accuracy of the automatic classification is improved.

Title: Evolutionary approach to multi-objective problems using adaptive genetic algorithms

Abstract: The paper describes an adaptive genetic algorithm used to achieve multi-objectives such as minimizing the territory losses and maximizing enemy air losses by finding the optimum distribution of aircraft fighting in a war scenario simulated by the THUNDER software. The adaptive genetic algorithm changes the mutation and crossover adaptively to provide fast convergence to the optimum possible solutions. According to the population of the fitness values obtained for each generation, three distribution properties (the mean, the variance and the best fitness value) are determined and used as input to a fuzzy-logic system for modifying the mutation and crossover rates to obtain the individuals of the next generation. This enables fast and smooth convergence to the best possible solutions.

Title: A meta-Gaussian approach to learning non-Gaussian Bayesian network structure

Abstract: Most existing approaches to learning the structure of Bayesian networks assume that all variables are discrete or that all variables are continuously normally distributed. We propose a meta-Gaussian approach that is appropriate for direct learning from general, continuous variables. We first transform the original variables into standard normal variables. Under the assumption that the transformed variables are multivariate normally distributed, we then make use of existing algorithms to learn the network structure in the transformed space, and then project the results back into the original space. Preliminary experimental results show that this approach can recover the network structure, provided that the variables of the network satisfy a fundamental monotonicity property.

Title: Adaptive goal prioritization by agents in dynamic environments

Abstract: We present a model for an agent architecture that supports adaptive goal prioritization. Goal prioritization is the ability of the agent to adjust the relative priorities of a goal set in response to changes in a dynamic environment. This architecture allows an agent to act pro-actively to achieve goals, and to dynamically determine which goals should be pursued at any time. We discuss a dynamic domain in which the architecture will be situated, and outline the techniques needed to support goal re-prioritization.

Title: Intelligent decision support systems

Abstract: We examine characteristics common to successful intelligent decision support systems. In doing this, we attempt to bridge the gap between disparate communities engaged in building various parts of these systems. Three systems were examined in detail from widely different applications and more than 20 additional systems were considered at a lower level of detail. By examining deployed decision support systems within the context of a broad framework we hope to capture the characteristics that can guide future development efforts. We see this as a first step in developing an in-depth compendium that will help bridge the gap between important yet typically isolated fields.

Title: Contribution-based approach for feature selection in linear programming-based models

Abstract: Feature selection is a significant problem in building any predictive model. Linear programming models which minimize the sum of deviations reward addition of variables if the added variables can reduce the sum of deviations. Deviation occurs when a point falls on the wrong side of the discriminant surface. If the groups are not linearly separable, and if the number of features is large, it is possible to create a model where some of the features used in the model account for a very small reduction in the deviations. We propose a feature selection scheme for LP models in which we measure the effect of each variable in increasing the interclass separation.

Title: Anytime replanning using locality in agent architectures

Abstract: Anytime planners seek to allow the system to exchange execution time for solution quality. We propose a new anytime planner which will devise new plans to accommodate plan failures. The first new plans to be considered will be relatively local to the plan that failed. Further new plans will be less and less local. We intend the concept of locality to relate the search space to be explored for a new plan to the degree to which a new plan disrupts the not-as-yet executed part of the running plan.

Title: A work domain analysis for virtual private networks

Abstract: For businesses, virtual private networking has become a new method of building corporate communication networks. In addition to providing improved flexibility, security and global reach, virtual private networks (VPNs) can offer substantial cost-savings by reducing the dependence on expensive, private leased-line networks and troublesome remote-access solutions. Unfortunately, the deployment and management of such systems may come at a high cost. Depending on the nature of the business relationship between the enterprise and the Internet Service Provider (ISP), the network manager may have to deal with the increasingly daunting task of configuring, operating, and fixing security leaks and other faults in the system as the communication needs of the organization expand and change. However, a new design technique known as ecological interface design (EID) has been shown to be a promising approach for supporting operator tasks in complex work domains, such as nuclear power plants or petrochemical systems. A distinguishing feature of this approach is that display interfaces are designed by first conducting a work domain analysis (WDA), which focuses on identifying the important goals and environmental constraints that govern system behavior. By visually portraying the relationships between system goals, constraints, and the state of physical components in a structured manner, the problem-solving activities of operators can be effectively supported during abnormal or unanticipated situations. Due to the problem-solving nature of VPN management, interfaces for network management tools can be made more effective through the application of EID principles.

Title: Economic prediction system using double models

Abstract: This paper proposes a model-selection-based economic prediction system with double models. The two models reflect short term and middle-long term trends of economic series respectively. This prediction system can solve problems of overfit or underfit that may beset prediction systems with a single model. MEBML (mind-evolution-based machine learning) is a new method of evolutionary computation proposed by the authors (1998). MEBML has better convergence performance and computational efficiency than genetic algorithms. A prediction system using MEBML can determine the forms, the orders and optimum parameters of the models, as compared with other methods.

Title: Organizing a network of databases using probabilistic reasoning

Abstract: Due to the complexity of real-world applications, the number of databases and the volumes of data in databases have increased tremendously. With the explosive growth in the amount and complexity of data, how to effectively organize the databases and utilize the huge amount of data becomes important. For this purpose, a probabilistic network that organizes a network of databases and manages the data in the databases is proposed. Each database is represented as a node in the probabilistic network and the affinity relations of the databases are embedded in the proposed Markov model mediator (MMM) mechanism. Probabilistic reasoning is used to formulate and derive the probability distributions for an MMM. Once the probability distributions of each MMM are generated, a stochastic process is conducted to calculate the similarity measures for pairs of databases. The similarity measures are transformed into the branch probabilities of the probabilistic network. Then, the data in the database can be managed and utilized to allow user queries for database searching and information retrieval. An example is included to illustrate how to model each database into an MMM and how to organize the network of databases into a probabilistic network.

Title: A fuzzy multiple objective programming approach for personnel selection

Abstract: There appears to be an increasing trend to the use of more systematic procedures in personnel selection. A fuzzy multiple objective programming approach for personnel selection is presented. The proposed method integrates the decision-maker's linguistic assessments about subjective factors such as excellence in oral communication skills, personality, leadership, and quantitative factors such as aptitude test score within the multiple objective programming framework. The importance degree of each objective is considered by applying the composition operator to the objective's membership function and the membership function corresponding to its fuzzy priority defined by linguistic variables. The decision approach presented is promising for a structured evaluation of the short-listed candidates.

Title: OLAP data cubes configuration with genetic algorithms

Abstract: We deploy a genetic algorithm to automate the selection of OLAP data cubes. In particular, we concentrate on constraint-handling techniques. We propose a greedy repair method to deal with the problem of infeasible candidates that violate constraints. As the experiments show, this repair method is effective in exploring as well as exploiting the search to find a good solution.

Title: Knowledgeable interface system using distributed multi-agents for mobile computer users

Abstract: To cope with industrial growth, efficient linkages are required to various divisions' systems, on different machines, from remote or mobile PCs. To meet this requirement, a knowledgeable interface system, MAKIS, for mobile computer users was developed. MAKIS comprises mobile (or remote) computers and server computers called wrap servers. MAKIS has three kinds of agents. It includes and utilizes flexibly organized goal-centered complex knowledge for system-linkage and business-operation. Utilizing this knowledge, MAKIS enables the prompt easy reuse of existing knowledge in conventional systems, in various sections, without changing their software, from remote or mobile PCs in a standard distributed environment. An experimental application to elevator renewal cost estimation proved the effectiveness of MAKIS. For example, using conventional systems, 17 screens were needed per estimation, but MAKIS needed only 1 screen. As a result even those who have little expertise either in estimation or in system linkage could make estimates promptly from outside the office.

Title: Knowledge based decision support system for matchmaking of enterprise competence

Abstract: When faced with a fast-changing global market, an enterprise needs to understand its own competence clearly, as well as assess its competence correctly according to the market demands. This paper focuses on the matchmaking of enterprise competence with competence requests. We propose a kind of knowledge-based decision support system (DSS) for the problem of competence matchmaking, which uses a multi-agent system. Agents in the system can be requestors or providers of competence, which can take advantage of the knowledge in the competence knowledge base to settle the problem of competence matchmaking through reasoning and interaction with other agents. This DSS has the capability of automatic quantitative reasoning, as well as its knowledge-based decision support capability.

Title: Integrated macroeconomic model (IMEM) and reasoning method for IMEM: combined qualitative-quantitative method

Abstract: Macroeconomic forecasting and control are complex problems, among which, the forecasting problem is basic but not easy. There are different methods for macroeconomic forecasting, however, these methods are still not well developed. This paper develops an integrated modeling framework that aims at formulating an integrated macroeconomic model. We explore the concept of and concepts related to the IMEM, and develop a combined qualitative-quantitative reasoning method for the IMEM. The concepts of the IMEM and its reasoning method are closely related. Along with our discussion, we give an example to show advantages of this approach.

Title: A new framework of a decision support system for air to air combat tasks

Abstract: We formulate and integrate some aspects of a fighter-pilot's decision making performance into a framework that can be used as a decision support system in air to air combat. The considered situation is an isolated air combat that incorporates two opposing fighters. The pilot's decision making preferences are used to establish the framework and to generate the rules governing its blocks. Issues such as stress, workload and any other degrading factors are ignored. An example is introduced to show how a combat problem fits into the proposed framework.

Title: A mobile agent based protocol for distributed databases access

Abstract: Presents a mobile agent-based three-tier protocol to improve the data transmission while accessing distributed databases. When a mobile agent is employed to fulfil a distributed query, it has many choices for travelling in the network. The master/slave pattern can be applied to mobile agents on the basis of a centralized two-phase commit (2PC) protocol to allow the parallel execution of mobile agents. In this paper, a three-tier protocol is proposed, which clusters all the slave agents to strengthen the parallelism. This three-tier protocol can significantly weaken the data transmission bottleneck and reduce the response time. This paper describes the protocol and a performance evaluation of it.

Title: Clustered transaction processing for electronic commerce

Abstract: As electronic commerce (EC) comes into wide use, transaction processing is playing a more important role. Although existing EC protocols provide the fundamental workflow of EC, the transaction processing facility is still insufficient, especially in aspects regarding the execution order of the transactions. Motivated by the observation that strict ordering of individual EC transactions is meaningless, we present clustered transaction processing for EC in order to realize relaxed execution ordering of transactions. Our proposed clustered transaction processing approach can support not only concurrency control but also recovery of the transaction processing in EC.

Title: XML based message queuing

Abstract: The technologies using message queues, which correspond to asynchronous communication in distributed processing, have become remarkable. In particular, object-oriented persistent message queuing has obtained reliability in the asynchronous communication of middleware. On the other hand, XML is a promising database tool which enables interoperability of document exchange in the heterogeneous business environment. This paper presents an XML-based message queue which unifies the format of the message and realizes easy data exchange in different applications. First, we present the XML messaging architecture. We also propose relevant issues concerning XML messaging, including the structural representation and several XML messaging operations. Not only FIFO operations but also advanced operations can be designed using information contained within the messages, owing to XML's features. Second, we present message queuing by XML. The representation of the message queue by means of XML and concurrent access to the message queue are proposed. Finally, we report an implementation of the XML-based message queue using Java programming. Throughout this paper, we show the efficiency of the proposed XML-based message queue.

Title: Dynamic multi-dimensional models for text warehouses

Abstract: Introduces a dynamic multi-dimensional model, which is suitable for building text warehouses. The dimensions are atomic semantic categories embedded in a familiar taxonomy. This approach to text warehouses requires a large number of dimensions, some of which may be not known in advance. Central to the dynamic multi-dimensional model is the meta-snowflake schema, which is a snowflake schema with an index table. The index table contains metadata on dimensions consisting of atomic and compound semantic categories. The documents stored in the warehouse are retrieved according to the semantic categories assigned to them. Such a text warehouse increases the precision and efficiency of document exploration.

Title: Modeling of supply chain: a multi-agent approach

Abstract: Describes the development of an agent-based software system for assisting in decision-making regarding supply chain management and the efficient and effective use of electronic data interchange (EDI) in the automobile industry. Such a system can be applied to different types of industries with some domain-specific modifications. The core architecture is built around the concept of a software-based agent that is programmed internally to interact with other external agents in a pre-defined manner. We are developing a MIC (model-integrated computing) based supply chain management modeling environment. This environment allows domain experts to create models of the software agents to simulate and control the actual online negotiation processes. The modeling environment allows modeling of agent behavior, as well as defining agent-to-agent interaction scenarios.

Title: Modeling, extraction and reuse of organizational knowledge

Abstract: Argues that multi-agent system design can be formalized by borrowing from artificial intelligence and software engineering concepts and techniques, such as ontologies, organization, decomposition and synthesis. We particularly focus on ontology sharing of software agents, define agencies as organizations of agents, propose a method to conceptualize the ontology of the domain using a multi-layered bipartite graph called a symbol structure (SS), and propose a method to extract organizational information from the SS of interacting agents. This information is then used in multi-agent system design and development.

Title: A design and implementation of object-oriented framework-based RAD tool (INTRAD)

Abstract: A framework is defined as a set of reusable designs of all or part of a software system described by set of abstract classes and the way in which instances of those classes collaborate. It is intended to capture the functionality that is common to several similar applications. By developing and reusing frameworks, the reuse also encompasses design and analysis. When programmers develop applications in a specific domain using a RAD (rapid application development) tool with which frameworks are provided, they can focus their attention on their particular problem domain and do not have to start from scratch each time they write applications. In this paper, we design and implement a framework diagram and a framework-based RAD tool, called INTRAD (INTranet RAD). Also, we implement an e-mail framework for the INTRAD system, which supports the development of intranet applications.

Title: A Bayesian network-based expert query system for a distributed database system

Abstract: A distributed database is a collection of data sources distributed across many computers. It is a single logical and centrally managed database stored in multiple physical locations. In order to access data locally and manage data globally, a good distributed database system (DDBS) that can supply reliable and up-to-date information is critical. A good DDBS should have functionalities such as providing users with timely and flexible access to information, providing DBA (database administrator) personnel with tools to analyze the data in a meaningful manner, and allowing the personnel to control the safety and integrity of the data. However, query processing in such a distributed database system is complicated. For example, some important issues are how to keep data up-to-date when it is physically dispersed, and how to propagate information to the whole DDBS when an update occurs. In response to these issues, we propose an expert query system that uses a Bayesian network as its framework to propagate information and to keep data up-to-date for a DDBS. The goal of this query system is to assist the DBA personnel in maintaining the data dynamically and to assist the users in accessing reliable and timely information.

Title: Evaluating intelligence: a computational semiotics perspective

Abstract: This paper discusses methods for evaluating the intelligence of intelligent systems by means of computational semiotics. Instead of looking at the system as a black box and testing its behavior, the process described focuses on architectural details of structures, organizations, processes and algorithms used in the construction of the intelligent system, evaluating the impact of using these elements in the overall intelligent behavior exhibited by the system. It proposes "insider" metrics that, coupled to "outsider" metrics, will be important for the determination of general metrics for intelligence in intelligent systems.

Title: BDD encoding for partial order constraints and its application to expert systems in software verification domains

Abstract: We introduce a class of computational problems called partial-order constraint satisfaction problems (POCSPs) for formulating the general problem of determining partial orders that satisfy the given constraints. Then we present some heuristic methods for encoding and solving these problems efficiently by using the binary decision diagram (BDD) data structure. Finally, we show that these methods can be successfully applied to expert systems in the subdomain of software verification.

Title: Some measurable characteristics of intelligent computing systems

Abstract: We discuss the following measurable characteristics of intelligent behavior in computing systems: (1) speed and scope of adaptability to unforeseen situations, including recognition, assessment, proposals, selection, and execution; (2) rate of effective learning of observations, behavior patterns, facts, tools, methods, etc., which requires identification, encapsulation, and recall; (3) accurate modeling and prediction of the relevant external environment, which includes the ability to make more effective abstractions, (4) speed and clarity of problem identification and formulation; (5) effective association and evaluation of disparate information; (6) identification of more important assumptions and prerequisites; and (7) the use of symbolic language, including the range and use of analogies and metaphors (this is about identification of similarities), and the invention of symbolic language, which includes creating effective notations. We make no claim that these are all the important characteristics; discovering others is the point of our research program.

Title: A critical analysis of bid pricing models and support tool

Abstract: This paper presents the characteristics of widely known bidding strategy models. The main characteristic of such models is that they over-simplify the bidding situation and therefore are difficult to use to model real life bidding. A new model (ServPrice) is proposed to overcome the disadvantages of the current bidding models. The analysis of all these models is based on a number of criteria which have been selected from both a large literature review on bidding models, as well as from the author's field experience in bid pricing. The comparison of these models has been made using a real life case provided by the telecommunication industry: bidding for carrier services.

Title: Real-time plant/ERP integration

Abstract: Manufacturing companies need to synchronize operating decisions made using ERP systems with plant floor operation because events at production plants directly affect business goals. Plant/ERP gateways allow companies to leverage production information to improve asset efficiency, reduce manufacturing cycle times, and provide reliable delivery dates to customers when orders are placed. Once companies understand the business advantages of plant/ERP integration, they must realize that ERP systems don't want raw sensor data from manufacturing plants. Calculations must be supported with predefined data transformation routines. Similarly, data unification software addresses the problem of inaccurate plant data. Finally, flexible analysis tools enable all employees to understand how their actions impact the cost and profit of the manufacturing business.

Title: An efficient method of setting BPR themes suitable for ERP package selection

Abstract: To select an ERP package and to customize it accurately, it is necessary for a company to set its business process reengineering (BPR) aims. Generally, there are two types of difficulty in setting BPR aims: 1) the company is short of skilled work force; and 2) the company does not allow the project enough time. This paper presents a method that enables one to set BPR aims easily using business sheets. This method consists of the following steps: 1) recognize the transformation of the management environment (the External Business Sheet); 2) recognize the current mechanism of business operations inside the company (Internal Business Sheet); 3) confirm mismatches between the environmental transformation and current business operations; and 4) set necessary action aims (BPR aims) to resolve the mismatches. Amongst these necessary actions, the project will pick up some aims that can be solved by an ERP package. These aims will be the basis of the business requirements in selecting an ERP package. This method reduces the period of discussion by 70%.

Title: Enterprise competence modeling and management

Abstract: It is very important for an enterprise to understand its competence and to improve it continuously, so as to better engage with the competitive market environment. This enterprise competence information is also valuable for potential cooperation among different enterprises. However, this information is often not available even within the enterprise itself, let alone for other enterprises, because there is no set of general methods for the modeling and management of enterprise competence. In this paper, we present a competence management system based on a common enterprise competence model (ECM), including a competence modeling method, system architecture, model-based decision support, and a core technology for system implementation.

Title: Supervisory control of flexible-manufacturing workcells that allow the production of a priori unplanned part types

Abstract: Traditionally, the function of a workcell supervisor has been to coordinate the various elements comprising the workcell for the production of a specific a-priori set of parts using a predetermined set of machines. Correspondingly, current workcell supervisor synthesis methodologies assume that the part production mix remains constant. In practice, however, the product mix may change over time. New part types are required to be processed, while other (nominal) part types may be temporarily discontinued. The workcell supervisory control approach proposed in this paper is that of utilizing a pair of non-communicating independent supervisors, working in concert to achieve the production of nominal and a-priori unplanned-for new part types: nominal and complementary supervisors. The nominal supervisor is responsible for controlling the behavior of the nominal workcell, producing the set of a-priori planned part types, while the complementary supervisor controls the flow of the unplanned-for new part types, where each supervisor is synthesized individually.

Title: Integrating concurrency control and distributed data into workflow frameworks: an actor model perspective

Abstract: Technological advances in processor power, networking, telecommunications and multimedia are stimulating the development of applications requiring parallel and distributed computing. This new perspective is enticing research into new design methodologies that view the software as an "intelligent" collection of agents that interact by coordinating knowledge-based processes. We present an actor-based workflow architecture that would fit naturally into distributed heterogeneous environments. The actors combine object-oriented and functional programming in order to make the management of concurrency easier for the user.

Title: Integrating object-oriented analysis with action logic for model building

Abstract: Decision models play an important role in decision-making, and supporting model-building is one of the most important functions of model management in decision support systems. As concepts at different abstract levels have to be used in the process of model-building, representing these concepts in a coherent way has been recognized as a key research topic. In this paper, a model-building framework is proposed which integrates object-oriented analysis with action logic as the representation tool. This model-building framework can provide representations for concepts at different abstract levels and can describe the process of abstracting decision models from decision situations or problems represented in lower abstract level concepts.

Title: MAISTeR: a user friendly software package for performance analysis and decision, based on (max,+) algebra

Abstract: This paper deals with a software package, called MAISTeR, that has been developed in collaboration with industry, which is concerned with the optimization of manufacturing systems that also involve human resources. A global model of the production line (or part of the line) is obtained by concatenation of sub-models, using a new approach using feedforward and feedback transfer equations based on the formal theory of (max,+) algebra.

Title: Project management using temporal logic programming

Abstract: Presents a methodology based on a temporal reasoning tool, called TEMPER, to model time-sensitive constraints of project management. The classical methods of project management, e.g. the critical path method (CPM), are adequate, however they lose some of the most important properties and requirements of a project. In this paper, we present a project management technique which enhances the language for inputting constraints and offers a modeling approach that captures aspects that are not covered by traditional methods.

Title: A framework for inferential problems in DEDS. III. Fault diagnosis

Abstract: For pt. II, see ibid., pp. 2168-73 (2000). Discusses the problem of fault diagnosis in a discrete event dynamic system (DEDS). We consider the timed transition model (TTM) framework for modeling DEDS behavior over time. We continue our discussion of issues related to modeling and state observation in TTMs for systems with unmeasurable variables by first discussing how faults are modeled in the extended framework of Part I (see ibid., pp. 2162-7, 2000). We then discuss the problem of state observation with delay, originally discussed in the context of finite state machines by C.M. Ozveren et al. (1990) and S. Bose et al. (1994). Finally, we show how a "with-delay observer" can be used for the detection and diagnosis of faults in a system modeled as a DEDS using the TTM framework.

Title: A reactive programming procedure for flexible manufacturing system

Abstract: Presents an online and reactive system of production scheduling for flexible manufacturing systems. The proposed system simultaneously schedules machining operations and transportation operations through an approach based on fuzzy logic, alternative part-production routes and multi-objective function programming or scheduling. The decision parameters in the decision-making are the routing distance, the due dates of parts and the next operation's processing time. A prototype was developed in order to illustrate the advantages of the proposed system.

Title: Regulation problem in discrete event systems using interpreted Petri nets

Abstract: The paper presents a new approach to control DES modeled by interpreted Petri nets (IPN). The controller is obtained mainly using structural information of the system; it is devoted to track the output of another IPN called the reference model. This control approach is based on the regulation problem from continuous systems control. It is shown that if the controller exists such that it solves the regulation problem, then the system and the reference model fulfils some conditions. Using both, the system and the reference model state, a state feedback control law can be implemented avoiding a feedback trajectory.

Title: A framework for inferential problems in DEDS. I. TTM based modeling

Abstract: Presents a timed automata approach for modeling discrete event dynamic systems (DEDS) in the context of supervision and monitoring of industrial processes by extending the TTM (timed transition model) framework. First, we propose the notion of measurement, and the consequent measurability or distinguishability of the measurement equivalence of state maps and transitions. This framework can be used for solving inferential problems in the area of state estimation and fault diagnosis. The state observation problem using this framework is solved with an example in a companion paper. We also characterize a number of reachability relations that help to capture the uncertainty of the system for a given sequence of measurable transitions.

Title: A framework for inferential problems in DEDS. II. State observation

Abstract: For Part I, see ibid., pp. 2162-7 (2000). We present an algorithm for state estimation under partial observation with time using an extended TTM (timed transition models). In particular, given the reachability graph (RG) of the original underlying TTM, the observer computes the state uncertainty that arises due to immeasurable state transitions along the given trajectories of the RG of the system, after the occurrence of every measurable transition or tick. The algorithm is illustrated by an example of a single-cylinder hydraulic punching machine.

Title: Dynamical local properties for estimation and control of discrete event systems modeled by interpreted Petri nets

Abstract: This paper studies the properties of observability, controllability and identification in discrete event systems (DESs) modeled with interpreted Petri nets (IPNs). It is important to note that these properties are defined using the states of the IPN and use structural information to characterize IPNs that exhibit these properties. This is an improvement on previous works because these definitions allow one to study more powerful control schemas.

Title: A temporal programmer for time-sensitive modeling of discrete event systems

Abstract: The paper presents a methodology for modeling temporal aspects of discrete-event systems. The methodology incorporates point and interval descriptions, and offers both a qualitative and quantitative calculus for time. A graph based temporal programmer (TEMPER) is shown to implement the axiomatic system of the temporal formalism. The approach transforms the temporal specifications into a graph structure, verifies the system for errors, and infers new qualitative and quantitative temporal information for system intervals and points.

Title: Reliable decentralized supervisory control of discrete event systems with marked language specifications

Abstract: We consider a discrete event system controlled by a decentralized supervisor consisting of n local supervisors. In our previous work, we studied reliable decentralized supervisory control for closed language specifications. We extend this work to the specifications given by marked languages. A decentralized supervisor is said to be k-reliable (1/spl les/k/spl les/n) if it exactly achieves a specification language without blocking under possible failures of any less than or equal to n-k local supervisors. So k denotes the minimal number of local supervisors required to achieve the specification. We present necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a k-reliable decentralized supervisor. Then we define a weaker version of k-reliability, called weak k-reliability, by relaxing the nonblocking requirement. We obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a weakly k-reliable decentralized supervisor. Moreover, we propose an iterative scheme for computing a sublanguage of a specification for which the existence conditions of a weakly k-reliable decentralized supervisor are satisfied.

Title: The model-based mind

Abstract: The "mind" can be defined as a range of functions created from sensory experience that are paired with our representation systems reflected through our behavior. These representation systems (visual, auditory and kinesthetic modalities) are foundations for how effective choices and belief systems are generated through sensory-derived processes; how decision-making and learning strategies are constructed; how memory is accessed, stored, retrieved or recalled, and how behavior and knowledge is actualized at both the conscious and unconscious levels. It is these same representational systems that provide us with the capability to model and replicate the cognitive processing of the human mind. This paper provides an explanation for modeling the inner workings of the 'cognitive black box', better known as the 'mind'.

Title: Supervisory control after perturbation

Abstract: Discrete event systems undergo perturbations, such as failures, that disrupt the control system and reduce the anticipation capacities of the future evolution of the process. Using the (max,+) algebra, processes modelled by a timed event graph may be represented by a linear model. The knowledge of the model and of the initial conditions enable one to characterize the state vector with a state equation iteration, but perturbations may generate a misappreciation of the state vector. This paper estimates the unknown state in order to predict the output trajectory and to calculate the control when the state vector is unknown.

Title: Why should engineers be interested in bizarre systems?

Abstract: Examines the shortcomings of conventional analysis when applied to complex processes, and considers the consequences of ignoring process behaviors simply because they do not conveniently project on to lists of numbers. Complex behavior is bizarre, but not absurd. Bizarre systems are counter-intuitive, and yet bizarre behavior is logically tractable. The inferential linkages within a bizarre system's epistemological model are congruent with the causal linkages that govern its ontological behavior. From the perspective of neurophysiology, the behaviors that we normally consider to be intelligent are irreducible to a list of numbers. This being the case, no list of numbers, no matter how big, can emulate intelligent behavior. To discuss intelligence other than by empirical observation, some logical description of it must be found that is not limited to predicative inferential structures. Mathematics abounds with such alternatives; impredicative mathematical entities provide powerful ways of describing complex behavior. They do so at a cost, being non-algorithmic. Engineering decisions based on predictions made by attempting to reduce complex behaviors to algorithms cannot be trusted; the projection ignores key aspects of the behavior. Present-day computers only work for algorithmic processes. An engineered artifact that exhibits intelligent behavior requires at least one, and possibly both, of the following developments: a more powerful model of computation than the Turing machine, and/or a computing element that has entailments similar to those observed in complex processes.

Title: Mapping function and structure for an anticipatory system: what impact will it have and is it computationally feasible, today?

Abstract: The development of complex biological behaviors, such as anticipation, in a machine requires more than having a reduced instruction set and a fast computer, a thought contrary to that shared by many researchers today. What is needed are new perspectives and insights into what complex biological forms are and what attributes are shared and/or differentiated by them. Only then will we really understand the cognitive process that elicits 'intelligence and consciousness' and how it may be invoked, at some level, in machines. This will require moving away from the Newtonian concept of reductionism and time as an index, towards new concepts that invoke time as an arrow that breaks the symmetry evident in classical mechanics. This paper provides an overview of the current thinking on anticipatory systems and what impacts they could have in and on our society. It identifies concerns that would be generated by the employment of such systems and formalizes a construct by which an anticipatory system model could be developed using today's technology.

Title: Recognizing a voice from its model

Abstract: Investigates a potential solution to the "large-population" speaker identification problem by characterizing a voice by the entailments in two different kinds of models. These entailments are found in the representational models of neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) and in the model of the mechanics of the voice as revealed by the continuous wavelet transform (CWT). Results to date have been obtained from examining samples in the TIMIT database and human subjects. Local features correlated with individual speakers for selected vowel sounds have been found in the CWT space. Features of NLP representation systems have also been found and are compared with voice features for speakers whose NLP representation systems are known a priori. Gaussian mixture models are used to calculate probability density functions from the local feature distributions. This speaker identification strategy combines three elements of novelty. First, it exploits the fact that the 2D CWT of a 1D signal can be interpreted as an image, and can thus use feature extraction techniques first developed for image processing. Second, voice waveforms are systematically studied to identify features that are attributed to the speaker's mental representation. Third, the reliability of the identification is strengthened by combining entailments from these two completely different aspects of the speaker's identity: the mechanical aspects of the speaker's vocal tract and the pattern of representation.

Title: Chaotic properties of rhythmic forearm movement

Abstract: Reveals the chaotic properties of voluntary single-arm and both-arm movements in various conditions of motion frequency and modes (single-arm mode, in-phase mode and anti-phase mode). Chaotic analyses of rhythmic forearm movements were performed, and it was confirmed that the chaotic characteristics represented by the correlation dimension and the largest Lyapunov exponents were included in the rhythmic forearm movements. Furthermore, it was clarified that there was a difference in the values of the Lyapunov exponents and the fractal dimensions between the right and left forearms, and consequently, the left forearm movement was more complex than the right forearm movement.

Title: A work domain model to support shipboard command and control

Abstract: Shipboard command and control presents unique challenges for decision support. Command decisions require an understanding of your own ship's capabilities as well as the capabilities and the intentions of friendly and hostile parties. While some actions can be pre-planned, naval decision makers will always be faced with unanticipated situations resulting from unknown variables in the environment or unexpected changes in their own equipment or technological capabilities. Decision support for these unanticipated situations demands that these operators be provided with as complete and flexible a model of the situation as possible. Ecological interface design is a design paradigm for unanticipated situations that has evolved from the domain of nuclear power, that bases its design on a cognitive work analysis (CWA) that is developed from work domain models. In this paper, we applied this approach to the domain of command and control for the Canadian Halifax-class frigate. In all, 38 work domain models were developed, from which we generated 132 information support requirements. This paper presents the first iterations of those models and discusses the application of this approach to the domain of command and control.

Title: A force/moment direction sensor and its use for human-robot interface in robot teaching

Abstract: The teach pendant is the most widely used means of robot teaching at present. Despite the difficulties of using the motion command buttons on the teach pendant, it is an economical, robust and effective device for robot teaching tasks. This paper presents the development of a force/moment direction sensor named COSMO (COntact Sensor MOdule) that can improve teach pendant-based robot teaching. An intuitive robot teaching experiment with a six-axis commercial robot using the sensor is described, where the operator holds the sensor in his hand, and moves the robot by pushing, pulling and hoisting the sensor in the direction of the desired motion. No prior knowledge of the tool or world coordinate system is required. The function of the COSMO sensor is to detect the presence of forces and moments about the principal axes of the sensor coordinate system. The transducer used in the sensor is a micro-switch, and this intuitive robot teaching method can be implemented at very low cost.

Title: Decentralized stabilization using descriptor systems

Abstract: A novel method for decentralized stabilization of a large-scale system in general form is presented. An appropriate descriptor system is defined for a large-scale system, such that the new system is in input decentralized form. Sufficient conditions for stability of the closed-loop system are introduced. By appropriately assigning the eigenstructure of each isolated subsystem, these conditions are satisfied. This is accomplished by using the method suggested by R.J. Patton and G.P. Liu (1994), such that the effects of the interconnections between the subsystems are minimized via the combination of genetic algorithms and gradient based optimization.

Title: Information-centered human-machine systems analysis for tactical command and control systems modeling and development

Abstract: In military operations and emergency management, operators and commanders must rely on distributed systems for safe and effective mission accomplishment. Tactical commanders and operators frequently encounter violent threats and critical demands on their cognitive capacity and reaction time. In the future, they will make decisions in situations whose operational and system characteristics are highly dynamic and nonlinear, i.e. small actions or decisions may have serious and irreversible consequences for the entire mission. Commanders and other decision makers must manage true real-time properties at all levels; individual operators, stand-alone technical systems, higher-order integrated human-machine systems and joint operations forces alike. Coping with these conditions in performance assessment, system development and operational testing is a challenge for practitioners and researchers. New results, new measurement techniques and new methodological advances facilitate a more accurate and deeper understanding, generating new and updated models. This in turn generates theoretical advances. This paper reports on research from which the results led to a breakthrough: an integrated approach to information-centered systems analysis to support future command and control systems research and development.

Title: Transient analysis of DOCSIS 1.1 cable modem networks

Abstract: The authors seek to identify the primary factors that determine the time-to-recovery of a network of DOCSIS-compliant cable modems (CMs). DOCSIS, which stands for Data-Over-Cable Service Interface Specifications (L.P. Holdings, 1999), is an emerging industry standard for data services over the cable TV infrastructure. According to the specification, individual cable modems must compete for access to the upstream channel, making it difficult to predict how long it will take for all CMs to initialize. We have developed a high fidelity simulation of the DOCSIS 1.1 upstream channel which allows us to test various upstream channel allocation rules. We have simulated networks of 200, 500, and 1000 CMs, and we have used the results to estimate the distribution function for the time-to-initialize for each topology. We have found that there is a tradeoff between optimizing the initialization process and the steady state operation of the network. In particular, allocation rules that reserve channel capacity for initialization lead to shorter initialization times at the expense of reduced capacity for the transmission of data.

Title: Decentralized control via eigenstructure assignment

Abstract: The problem of achieving stability and block-diagonal dominance for linear large-scale systems by decentralized feedback is considered. Sufficient conditions for stability and block-diagonal dominance of the closed-loop system are introduced. By appropriately assigning the eigenstructure of each isolated subsystem via output feedback or state feedback, these conditions are satisfied. This can also be accomplished by using the method suggested by R.J. Patton and G.P. Liu (1994), such that the effects of the interconnections between the subsystems are minimized via the combination of genetic algorithms and gradient-based optimization.

Title: Optimization based decision trees for multi-modal problems

Abstract: Multi-modal problems are amongst the most difficult-to-handle classification problems, especially for traditional statistical techniques. Multi-modal problems arise when each class region can occupy disjoint areas in feature space. Backpropagation neural networks and decision tree classifiers (DTCs) can typically handle multi-modal problems. We introduce a decision tree based on clustering and linear programming and compare its performance to CART on a number of data sets from the literature, including several sets that exhibit clear multi-modal structure.

Title: Distributed denial of service attacks

Abstract: We discuss distributed denial of service attacks in the Internet. We were motivated by the widely known February 2000 distributed attacks on Yahoo!, Amazon.com, CNN.com, and other major Web sites. A denial of service is characterized by an explicit attempt by an attacker to prevent legitimate users from using resources. An attacker may attempt to: "flood" a network and thus reduce a legitimate user's bandwidth, prevent access to a service, or disrupt service to a specific system or a user. We describe methods and techniques used in denial of service attacks, and we list possible defences. In our study, we simulate a distributed denial of service attack using ns-2 network simulator. We examine how various queuing algorithms implemented in a network router perform during an attack, and whether legitimate users can obtain desired bandwidth. We find that under persistent denial of service attacks, class based queuing algorithms can guarantee bandwidth for certain classes of input flows.

Title: Population classification for managed healthcare within a state-based modeling framework

Abstract: The healthcare industry currently accounts for more than 12% of the United States Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The industry is struggling with a shift from the "Fee For Service" compensation model prevalent during the 20th Century to a delivery model based on some form of "Managed Care". Efforts at implementing capitation rate contracts with physicians have been significantly hampered by the inability to accurately forecast and adjust for risk differences among various practice populations. We approach the problem within the framework of state based modeling to develop state definitions that represent homogeneous sub-populations. We use the state definitions to develop a first order Markov model for healthcare expense prediction and compare performance to the current state of the art of expense prediction models on actual data from a family practice in Calgary.

Title: Performance modeling of the advanced field artillery tactical data system

Abstract: Planning of complex activities is a deliberative process and automation support for re-planning activities should provide for cognitive modeling of the planning process. One approach for modeling military planning systems is to partition the process into separable components and analyze the components individually. The paper takes the position that the cognitive model should contain details of the domain being supported and, especially for support of online re-planning, knowledge of the system implementation architecture, including performance modeling of the implementation architecture. A possible issue is the failure of the separable components assumption when the system is composed of components. We discuss these thoughts in some detail and provide an overview of a test bed framework being implemented to perform experiments on the validity of this approach. In particular, we are interested in creating analysis tools that apply metrics to sensed data to assist in determining when a re-planning activity is required and in prioritizing re-planning activities. The framework is intended to support experiments with military decision making and, in particular, with re-planning activities that support execution of a military operation order (OPORD). We are investigating use of a simulation tool to accumulate information at the message-packet-level and perform analysis at the network-application-level. We discuss use of this framework for pattern recognition of activities distributed in time and space. We provide an introduction to our approach for partitioning the problem space and some ideas on design of experiments using this approach.

Title: A description language based on multi-functional modeling and a supply chain simulation tool

Abstract: It is difficult to analyze the performance of a supply chain philosophically because of the complexity of the supply chain. Therefore, in order to evaluate the control algorithms for a supply chain, simulation is an effective method. However, it is difficult to describe an entire supply chain because of the large variety and number of components in a supply chain. The paper proposes a description language in which an entire supply chain is described efficiently. It also describes the simulation engine which efficiently determines the execution priority of events, and the simulation tool based on the proposed language which has been developed.

Title: Deriving heuristics in evolutionary algorithms through families of focused experiments

Abstract: Over the last decade (1990-2000), the field of evolutionary computation has experienced a very rapid growth. However, the existence of overly many parameters and choices in directing the optimization (search) process requires some additional heuristics. These heuristics may be derived from focused experiments that reveal an impact of the particular parameter on the efficiency of search for a global optimum. The paper concentrates on evolution strategies (ES), a subset of evolution programs developed as methods for numerical optimization, and in particular on multimembered (/spl mu/+/spl lambda/)-ES, where /spl mu/ individuals produce /spl lambda/ offspring. The paper analyzes the influence of various recombination techniques on the convergence rate of (/spl mu/+/spl lambda/)-ES. Experimental explorations of various recombination techniques are performed on the optimization task of nine standard, well-known objective functions.

Title: Feedback control techniques for gradient based learning

Abstract: The well-known gradient descent based learning strategy is considered as a feedback control system. In order to improve the convergence performance of the gradient based learning, both a proportional+integral+derivative (PID) control based gradient descent learning and a fuzzy control plus gradient descent learning strategies are proposed. The convergence properties of the proposed methods are discussed. The comparison investigation concerns the gradient technique and the proposed approaches are finally illustrated.

Title: A parallel reinforcement computing model for function optimization problems

Abstract: Learning Automaton is a learning model with outstanding learning ability, autonomy and guaranteed convergence in the learning process. We propose a parallel computing model with learning automata for function optimization problems and implement it as a sparse distributed parallel computing system. The problems with the traditional reinforcement method using learning automata are: increased difficulty of the adjustment of learning parameters and that of convergence time, with an increased output number. To overcome these problems, we introduce a genetic algorithm (GA) to construct a search space with reduced dimension to search for the optimal output from the entire output space, and provide an efficient way of searching for the smaller-sized search space for the optimal solution. The results of computer simulations verify the usefulness of the proposed method for multivariable function optimization problems.

Title: Landscape analyses and global search of knapsack problems

Abstract: Presents statistical analyses of the search-space landscape of knapsack problems in due consideration of stochastic optimization. It is known from existing works that travelling salesman problems have a rugged landscape. We deal with 1000 knapsack problems where the values and the weights of the objects are arranged randomly. By introducing proper estimate values and topology, it is revealed that the landscape of these knapsack problems is a rugged landscape similar to that of the travelling salesman problems. It is assumed that the rugged landscape is a combination of a global valley-like structure and a local noise-like structure. We propose a new algorithm to estimate the optimum point by introducing the least mean square method to fit the global structure at some points selected randomly in the search space. The method does not contradict "no free lunch" theorems because of the availing features of the landscape. It is forecast that not only knapsack problems but also many practical problems have a structure which is characterized with the same measure. These results are useful in order to compose more effective optimization methods without a trial-and-error process.

Title: A method for the shortest path search by extended Dijkstra algorithm

Abstract: The Dijkstra method is a well-known algorithm for finding the optimum path in shortest-path search problems. With that method, however, the time required to find the optimum path becomes remarkably long when the search scope is broad, so the Djikstra method is not suitable for real-time problems. In this paper, we propose a method for obtaining, in a short time, a path that is as close as possible to the path obtained by the Dijkstra method (the optimum path). The new method extends the conventional Dijkstra method so as to obtain a solution to a problem given within a specified time, such as path search in a car navigation system. The effectiveness of that extended method is described through use of simulations.

Title: Optimization algorithms in organizational design: optimality and complexity

Abstract: Presents a classification of the optimization problems arising in the normative design of organizations to execute specific missions. The use of specific optimization algorithms for different phases of the design process leads to an efficient matching between the mission structure and that of an organization and its resources/constraints. It allows an analyst to obtain an acceptable trade-off among multiple objectives and constraints, as well as between computational complexity and solution efficiency (desired degree of sub-optimality).

Title: Reflected method for having consciousness

Abstract: When we think and look at things, things' behaviours, and things' phenomenon, we have an "attention" towards a target object: things/things' behaviours/phenomenon. Then we try to think about what it is, how it is, why it is, and so forth in order to recognize it. Then we can identify the target object and we will be able to recognize/decide what we want to do: examine or eat or touch an object consciousnessly. These mechanisms (Attention/spl rarr/Think/spl rarr/Recognition/spl rarr/Behaviour) are the elements of being conscious. But each mechanism may not behave as individually as it looks. There must exist a relation among them as a liaison. As the liaison mechanism, the author proposes a consciousness mechanism: "Reflection". "Reflection" is an idea for recognition mechanism of things by differentiating things outside and inside itself. In Reflection, the author also proposes the Primitive Element Process for understanding the treatment in Reflection.

Title: A modular modeling approach for CNC machines control using Petri nets

Abstract: Machine control can be executed in an integrated way using computerized numeric control (CNC) and the programmable logical controller (PLC). CNC deals with axes positioning and speed, the part cut off sequence and the operator interface, while PLC deals with machine interlocking, emergency sequences, start and stop sequences, among others, considering its environment integration. The machine PLC control can be divided into interlocking and sequencing control functions. The article proposes a modular machine PLC control modeling approach using Petri nets. This approach also considers a risk analysis task that defines and classifies the hardware and software interlocking to be implemented to avoid loss and damage. In this approach, the machine PLC control model can be constructed and the Petri net analysis technique can be used to verify and validate it.

Title: Efficient computation of enabled transition bindings in high-level Petri nets

Abstract: We present an algorithm for the computation of enabled transition bindings in high level Petri nets. The algorithm does not depend on either functional or logic language features, but may be implemented in commonly used imperative languages. To achieve this, we show that a high level Petri net transition, together with its input arcs, input places and place markings, constitutes an extended type of finite domain constraint satisfaction problem. Calculation of all transition bindings corresponds to solving such a problem, which we term a resource value CSP. We show how the use of multi-sets in net markings and arc expressions leads to resource constraints. We describe the extension of an existing efficient CSP algorithm to enable solution of resource value CSPs. The new algorithm, FC-CBJ-M, has been used for the simulation and analysis of Coloured and PrT nets.

Title: Using UML and object-coordination-nets for workflow specification

Abstract: The specification of intra- and inter-organizational workflows in a manner which scales up to complex workflows across division and company borders is a central issue for present-day workflow modeling. The approach described integrates standard object oriented structure modeling using UML diagrams with Petri net techniques for specifying behavior in order to provide an adequate support for modeling all aspects of workflows. The approach puts its emphasis on structuring and abstraction techniques to manage the size and complexity of real life applications. A contract mechanism is used to ensure the independence of different companies and to permit the reuse of partial workflows in a manner which is secure for the offering as well as the usage side.

Title: Resource sharing estimation by Petri nets in PISH hardware/software co-design system

Abstract: The article presents two approaches for computing the number of functional units in a hardware/software codesign context. The proposed hardware/software codesign framework uses the Petri net as a common formalism for performing quantitative and qualitative analysis. The use of the Petri net as an intermediate format allows us to analyze properties of the specification and formally compute performance indices which are used in the partitioning process. The paper is devoted to describing the algorithms for functional unit estimation. The work also proposes a method of extending the Petri net model in order to take into account causal constraints provided by the designers. However, an overview of the general hardware/software codesign method is also presented.

Title: Modeling mobile agent systems with high level Petri nets

Abstract: The paper presents a Petri net based approach for architectural modeling of mobile agent systems. An agent template (net) is proposed to model a changing number of autonomous and communicative software agents. An agent space is explicitly abstracted as a component, consisting of mobility environment (system net), agent templates (agent nets), and internal connector (net). Agent transfer is naturally captured by transition firing. To assure the strong mobility, the agent's state is delivered during migration. Agent mobility in OMG's MASIF is also examined by formalizing the interoperable agent system architecture.

Title: Petri-net-based business process modeling for virtual enterprises

Abstract: The paper presents our studies on Petri net based business process modeling for virtual enterprises. A virtual enterprise (VE) is a temporary alliance of member enterprises. Generally, a business process consists of a series of logically interrelated activities, to which appropriate resources will be assigned. In the virtual enterprise, both the activities and the resources are in multiple member enterprises, while collaborations exist among these distributed activities and resource sharing is often required. Thus, the modeling of business processes in virtual enterprises is challenging work. Based on Petri nets, the paper proposes a business process modeling method for virtual enterprises, which focuses on the two basic elements of the business process: activities and resources, while addressing their properties of distribution and collaboration particular to virtual enterprises.

Title: Optimal structure analysis of universal learning network with multi-branches

Abstract: Owing to the special characteristics of neural networks, the optimization of their structure is paid great attention. As the theoretical study and case analysis develop, the insufficiencies of networks with a single branch between nodes appear. (1) The loose structure when a single connection is used between nodes limits the application of neural networks in practice. Therefore, a compact network structure with multi-branches is required. (2) When a link branch from one node to another is eliminated, the signal transmission will be cut off completely between nodes. (3) Adaptability to the sharp change of inputs is poor. The paper, aiming at overcoming these insufficiencies, presents a method to create an optimal network structure. The basic idea of the proposed procedure is to introduce a Universal Learning Network (ULN) with multi-branches between nodes, then, meeting the demand of optimal structure, to eliminate unnecessary branches but not all of them. As a result, while the signal transmission is kept up, the network structure becomes compact. The problem of optimizing the structure of neural networks is to get the best balance between training precisely and generalization ability. Ensuring training precisely, the generalization ability of networks can be improved by the proposed procedure.

Title: Steady state of continuous neutral weighted marked graphs

Abstract: Hybrid Petri Nets (PN), combining T-timed discrete PN and continuous PN, are convenient for the modelling and the performance analysis of fluid systems or manufacturing systems such as batch or high speed production systems. For instance, the continuous process can be modelled by a continuous PN while the state of machines, up or down, can be represented by a discrete PN. The aim of the paper is to characterise the timed dynamic behaviour of continuous PN with constant speed. More precisely, the final values of the instantaneous firing speeds of continuous neutral weighted marked graph, supposed live, are determined independently of the initial marking and without using the timed evolution. Finally an application to a flow system is given.

Title: Developing adaptive buffer-level synchronization algorithm by Petri nets for improving quality of multimedia related services

Abstract: Multimedia synchronization is one of the key issues to be resolved in order to provide a good quality of multimedia related services, such as video on demand (VoD) and lecture on demand (LoD). The authors introduce the Adaptive Buffer-Level Synchronization Algorithm, which is modeled and analyzed by ExSpect, a Petri net based simulation tool. In the suggested algorithm, the audio and video buffers are divided to 5 different levels, and the pre-defined play-out speed controller tries to make the buffer level normal in different temporal relations between multimedia streams. The suggested algorithm is able to handle and support various communication restrictions between providers and users, and offers little jitter play-out to many users in networks having limited transmission capability. The performance of the developed algorithm is analyzed in various network conditions using a Petri net simulation tool. Some important aspects of simulation results compared to other approaches are also presented.

Title: Control logic generation for machining systems using Petri net formalism

Abstract: The logic controller for a machining system is a discrete event supervisory system. In high volume transfer lines, it consists of three control modes: auto, hand, and manual. A logic controller can achieve the goal of a machining system by its control logic. The paper addresses a formal Petri net representation of the control logic and its implementation. The control logic is represented by two Petri net models: one for the mode decision control logic and the other for the sequence control logic. Because the Petri net models are live, safe, and reversible, the actual logic control program can be generated directly from the Petri net models by using IEC1131-3 programming languages.

Title: A new heuristic method for solving the minimum initial marking problem of Petri nets

Abstract: The paper proposes a novel heuristic algorithm FMDB for the minimum initial marking problem MIM of Petri nets: "Given a Petri net and a firing count vector X, find an initial marking M, with the minimum total token number, for which there is a sequence /spl delta/ of transitions such that each transition t appears exactly X(t) times in /spl delta/, the first transition is firable on M and the rest can be fired one by one subsequently". Experimental results show that FMDB produces better solutions than any known algorithm.

Title: Adaptive job-shop scheduling with routing and sequencing flexibility using expert knowledge and coloured Petri nets

Abstract: Petri nets are known to be efficient for modeling manufacturing systems, because they have a graphical representation and a well-defined semantics allowing format analysis. Considering conflicts as routing and sequencing alternatives, we propose a knowledge based algorithm for online scheduling, that guides the search for a near optimal schedule in the state space efficiently and limits the state space explosion problem. Taking into account that expert knowledge is formulated mostly in natural language, the inference process is modeled by an approximate reasoning scheme consistent with possibility theory. For refining initial knowledge, a concept is presented that combines reinforcement learning techniques with a possibilistic clustering method. Finally, our approach is validated by a numerical example, showing especially that the use of expert knowledge heuristically guides the search for a near optimal solution of the scheduling problem.

Title: Maneuvering target tracking using constant velocity and constant angular velocity model

Abstract: The paper summarizes a maneuvering target tracking using a tracking filter with constant velocity and constant angular velocity model. A constant velocity model or a constant acceleration model is often used as a dynamic model of a tracking filter. If a target turns, these filters can not give full performance due to the disagreement between the real target and these models. In order to solve the problem, we propose a tracking filter using constant velocity and constant angular velocity model. This model has few disagreements of the dynamic model. The effectiveness of this scheme is confirmed through computer simulations.

Title: Optimal trajectory generation for redundant planar manipulators

Abstract: Given the desired end effector poses (position and orientation) at the start and end points in a pick and place operation, motion planning for a redundant manipulator in a structured environment involves the generation of a smooth motion profile which not only satisfies the specified boundary conditions, but is also optimal with respect to some specified criterion. A new approach to this optimal point-to-point motion planning problem for kinematically redundant manipulators is proposed. The approach combines the use of B-spline curves for the generation of smooth trajectories, with the use of genetic algorithms for finding an optimal solution to the motion planning problem. A numerical example is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of this approach.

Title: Semi-automatic control of overhead crane using potential method

Abstract: In practical industries, overhead traveling cranes are usually manipulated by a human operator. The transfer object can be freely moved in three-dimensional space by the human operator for various tasks. Although manipulation for the moving direction of a crane is easy, the crane's operation without vibration of a load is difficult for unskilled operators, and therefore swinging of the object occurs and residual vibration is generated after the transfer object reaches a goal point. Therefore, a semi-automatic control system is proposed in terms of obstacle avoidance by manual operation by human operator and feedback control for suppression of swing by automatic controller. Further, in order to heighten safety and prevent human error, the command input to avoid obstacles and go towards a goal is generated by the fusion of human command using joystick and potential information using diffusion equation based on the known environment map. Position and vibration control of a crane are carried out by a fixed-pole controller for the command input (stated previously). The usefulness of the proposed method is demonstrated through simulation and experimental studies.

Title: An Ideal Proportional Navigation Guidance system for moving object interception-robotic experiments

Abstract: An Ideal Proportional Navigation Guidance (IPNG) technique is applied to the problem of intercepting a fast maneuvering object in real time using an industrial robotic manipulator. A hybrid method is utilized, in which IPNG is combined with a conventional tracking method to ensure smooth interception. The method is suited for the interception of both fast maneuvering as well as slow maneuvering targets, and does not require long term target trajectory prediction. Experimental results are reported.

Title: Self-tuning control of a translational flexible arm using neural networks

Abstract: The self-tuning control of a translational flexible arm using neural networks is presented. The control scheme consists of a gain tuning neural network and a variable-gain feedback controller. This neural network is trained so as to make the error between the root shear force and the reference root shear force zero. In the process, the neural network learns the optimal gain of the feedback controller. The feedback controller is designed based on Lyapunov's direct method. The feedback control of the motion of the flexible system is derived by considering the time rate of change of the total energy of the system. This approach has the advantage over conventional methods in that it allows one to deal directly with the system's partial differential equations without resorting to approximations. Numerical and experimental results for the tracking control of a translational flexible arm are presented and verify that the proposed control system is effective at controlling flexible dynamical systems.

Title: Control to realize human-like walking of a biped humanoid robot

Abstract: The paper describes the balance control of biped locomotion systems. A biped humanoid robot is modeled and studied focusing on the realization of human-like walking. Firstly, the smooth motion of its lower limbs is characterized in terms of a set of walking variables. Secondly, to cancel moments produced by the motion of the lower limbs, the motion of its trunk and waist is derived by an iteration method. Finally, program control using a preset walking motion is applied to the biped robot. To confirm human-like walking, we have constructed a human-like biped robot called WABIAN-RII (WAseda BIped HumANoid robot-Revised II) that has a total of forty-three mechanical degrees of freedom (DOF). Experiments of a human-follow walking are conducted using the WABIAN-RII.

Title: Modeling train control systems with Petrinets-an operational specification

Abstract: European cooperation and new technologies have an effect on the process of requirements specification in the development of train control systems. The meaning of requirements specification under these circumstances and aspects of the system which have to be described in it are discussed. With the goal of achieving a complete behavior specification in a methodically efficient manner, a modeling approach to the recording and description of the relevant aspects is introduced. The approach is based on the use of coloured Petri nets as a formal notation allowing formal analysis. Using the case example of a decentralized level crossing control system, the operational view and its model representation are explained. This view is consistently extended across the technical concept of the system by systematic refinement of the model. Not only the regular technical events realizing the operational requirements, but also alternatives occurring by system malfunction are taken into account. Furthermore, operational events which deviate from the regular course of behavior are integrated, so that the produced model leads to a closed illustration of the permissible system behavior from an operational view in reference to its technical conception.

Title: Cartesian coordinate control for redundant modular robots

Abstract: The paper focuses on the kinematic control of redundant modular robots for trajectory tracing. Based on the geometric numerical inverse kinematic algorithm developed for modular robots, a new online control method is presented. In this method, the inverse kinematic solution can be optimized through constructing a weighted matrix. Following this approach, some fundamental interpolation algorithms are proposed for Cartesian space (task space) control of redundant modular robots. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms has been experimentally demonstrated by a 7-DOF serial modular robot that performs a pick-and-place task with the avoidance of joint angle limits.

Title: Using trinocular vision to build a real-time world model

Abstract: The Department of Energy (DOE) in the USA, in its effort to clean up and shut down many of its radioactive facilities, would like to use robots to enhance efficiency and limit worker exposure to hazardous substances. Unlike industry, where the work environment is designed to facilitate robots, the DOE applications often have unknown, unstructured work areas. The paper describes an approach to use a trinocular image processing system to build a real time, simple representation of the objects in the workspace. This representation is needed for safe navigation as well as for manipulation of the objects in the workspace.

Title: An optimal robot tracking controller with application in the finite horizon case

Abstract: A control law for a rigid robotic manipulator optimizing quadratic cost functional composed of sliding surface and its derivative for fixed final time and free final state was proposed by Z. Ahmad (1995; 2000). Closed form solutions for such a control law corresponding to constant in time and specific diagonal time-varying weighting matrices are presented. These closed form solutions for the two point boundary value problem greatly reduce computational load and allow for real time implementation. Simulation results for a two degree of freedom manipulator are also provided.

Title: Position/force control of biped walking robots

Abstract: The paper addresses the problem of modelling and control of a biped robot by combining Cartesian based position and force control algorithms. The complete walking cycle is divided into two phases: i) single support, in which is studied the trajectory controllability based on simple motion goals and ii) exchange of support, in which the forward leg absorbs the impact and then gradually accepts the robot's weight. The contact of the foot with the constrained surface is modelled through linear spring-damper systems. The system's controllability is enhanced through the insertion of a dynamic selection matrix that modifies the actuating profile in each phase. The control algorithms are simulated and their effectiveness and robustness are discussed.

Title: A behavior-based control architecture

Abstract: The presented control architecture is designed to support the development of intelligent control systems that are connected to the real world via sensors and actuators, and deal with dynamic and partly unpredictable environments, for instance to control an autonomous mobile robot. With quite an implementational effort, existing control architectures allow us to implement navigation facilities on a certain mobile robot. However, additional criteria that interfere with the navigational movements can usually not be added subsequently. Note that this situation occurs, e.g. if active sensing is requested, a handling device is added or other additional requirements arise. The purpose of the presented architecture is, first to allow easy implementation and second to obtain a modular control system that displays a kind of superposition characteristic. Considering a typical behavior based architecture, we focus on the method to coordinate the different mechanisms. The question is, how to combine commands or preferences of several running mechanisms. In our approach, we solve this merging problem by using a utility based approach. Each mechanism continuously evaluates sensory data with respect to its special sub-task in order to rate all actions of a certain actuator. These ratings result in a utility function, that also includes the priority of the performed sub-task of the mechanism. A fusion component then merges these distributions for each actuator, following a theorem of R.L. Keeny and H. Raiffa (1976).

Title: Nomadic routing applications for wireless networking in a team of miniature robots

Abstract: Distributed robotics uses multiple robots through coordination of task to solve problems. Developing a distributed robotic system introduces a number of challenges, one of which is the intra-robot communication and networking of data and commands. Due to the characteristics of the targeted robotic missions and environments, the wireless networking requirements impose stringent constraints in terms of available memory, processing, and power consumption. Designing under these constraints and still providing support for such functions as synchronous commands and proxy processing is the true challenge. This paper discusses research in providing a lightweight wireless routing/networking solution that can dynamically tune the intra-robotic networking to adapt to the robotic team's mission needs and the environment situation encountered.

Title: Data based dynamical modeling of vision observed small robots

Abstract: Until recently the control and navigation of mobile robots was mainly performed based on exteroceptive sensoring. Recent investigation on the cooperation of multiple robotic agents with centralized control, has ushered in small and less sophisticated robots that are observed by a global vision system. This paper presents a modeling methodology that enables accurate prediction of such small robot's position and orientation from data measured using the global vision system. Results of several experiments show that the model is both accurate and robust. Another relevant aspect of the work is the ability to determine the limitations likely to be found in centralized control of agents with little or no local "intelligence".

Title: Fault tolerant gaits of legged robots for locked joint failures

Abstract: In this paper, fault detection and tolerance in static walking of legged robots are addressed. A kind of fault events, locked joint failure, is defined and its properties are investigated in the frame of gait study and robot kinematics. For the purpose of tolerating a locked joint failure, an algorithm of fault tolerant gaits for a quadruped robot is proposed in which the robot can continue its walking after a locked failure occurs to a joint of a leg. A case study on applying the proposed scheme to wave gaits verifies its applicability and capability.

Title: Behavior modification for continuous locomotion of brachiation-type mobile robot

Abstract: The authors propose an adaptation and learning algorithm to adjust behavior coordinator against small changes of the objective task or a new one. This method measures the relation between the each local behavior and the global behavior, and then determines the direction of change of the activation values from the behavior coordinator based on the measurements. The monkey-type locomotion robot, Brachiator III has 13 links and 12 joints and is able move like a real ape in a three-dimensional space. The controller is designed for a primitive case. The proposed algorithm is used when the branch interval is changed and when continuous locomotion is desired. We show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm through experiments using Brachiator III.

Title: Dynamic dispatching of coordinated sensors

Abstract: Sensory data must be collected in real time for the majority of autonomous decision making tasks, such as target tracking, surveillance and navigation. The use of multiple sensors may significantly improve the quality and robustness of the data. Given an environment containing a set of mobile sensors, capable of altering their position and orientation, this work addresses the problem of selecting and maneuvering subsets of these sensors for optimal data acquisition in realtime. A heuristic approach to the dispatching problem suitable for on-line implementation is illustrated by a computer simulated example.

Title: On Lyapunov's stability control of two-link base-excited inverted pendulums with applications to human locomotion

Abstract: Control of a chain of two planar inverted pendulums is studied in this paper. The goal is to keep the pendulums at the upright position in spite of the free base point motion. First a piecewise continuous controller is developed which guarantees the global stability of the system in the sense of Lyapunov. This idealized controller, however, is not desirable from the implementation viewpoint. A continuous control law is then proposed. It is found that the continuous controller only guarantees the stability in a suitable sense. The effectiveness of the developed controllers is tested through computer simulations. The above inverted pendulums are then used to simulate human thorax and pelvic movement during walking. The simulation results are compared with those from gait measurements and found that the above pendulums are capable of producing displacements and torques for the human thorax and the pelvis during normal walking.

Title: Genetic optimisation of manipulation forces for co-operating robots

Abstract: Force planning for co-operating manipulators requires the solution of an underdetermined set of linear equations, which yields infinitely many solutions. The task then becomes that of locating the best solution from the infinite set. Various methods have been proposed for this optimisation problem, including pseudo inverses and search algorithms. This paper adopts a non-linear optimisation approach using genetic algorithms (GA). GAs have well known capabilities for searching complex function spaces. It is shown in this work that real number GAs provide a powerful force-planning method for co-operating manipulators. The effectiveness of the algorithm is illustrated with a numerical example.

Title: Adaptive control of free-floating space manipulators

Abstract: In this paper, we model a free-floating space manipulator system using Dynamically Equivalent Model (DEM) approach. The DEM is a fixed-base manipulator system and allows us to linearly parameterize the dynamic equations. Using this linearly parameterized dynamic equation, an adaptive control method is developed to control the system in joint space. Simulation results are given to show the validity of the presented identification and control scheme.

Title: Feedforward control of a mobile robot using a neural network

Abstract: Many papers about mobile robot control deal only with the kinematic model of the robot. Since it is the kinematics and not the dynamics that introduces the nonholonomicity into the system, this approach provides a simple model while preserving the most interesting portion of the system. However, for large robots, or robots moving at high speeds, the dynamics of the body can not be neglected. This paper proposes a controller for a nonholonomic mobile robot developed by combining a kinematic controller based on nonsmooth discontinuous transformation and a dynamic controller based on a neural network (computed torque like). The overall system stability is proved by Lyapunov theory.

Title: Mobile robot localization using an electronic compass for corridor environment

Abstract: This paper proposes a simple method for localization using an electronic compass. Electronic compasses are often used to detect the heading of mobile robots. However, electronic compasses have one drawback when used inside a building: they can easily be disturbed by electromagnetic sources (e.g., power lines) or large ferro-magnetic structures (e.g., bookshelves). However, this paper introduces another indoor application of electronic compasses. We take advantage of the magnetic field disturbances by using them as distinctive place recognition signatures. We first gather information about the changing heading as our robot travels along the hallway outside the lab, and then store this information. As the robot traverses the hallway, it gathers the information from the electronic compass and matches it with the pre-stored data. If a match is found, the robot can determine its current position. We use a sequential least-squares approximation approach for matching the signature. The simulation results will show that the robot can distinguish its location by using these signatures.

Title: The application of the grey relation analysis on teacher appraisal

Abstract: Teacher appraisal plays an important role in the trend of the professionalization of the educational enterprise, that could promote teacher's qualities in each school. The main purpose of this study was to use grey relation analysis on a teacher appraisal scale, and compare it with fuzzy analysis and traditional mean analysis, to find the advantages and disadvantages of each analysis method. Four factors were included in the teacher appraisal scale, which were: teaching preparation, teaching process, teaching strategy, and teaching evaluation, several items were included in each factor. The conclusions of this study are shown: for the result and rank of teaching factor, there is no statistical difference between grey relation analysis and mean analysis; and for the overall distribution of the teaching appraisal items fuzzy analysis was recommended for the analysis. Finally, grey relation analysis is an exploration method for teacher appraisal analysis worth future study.

Title: Investigation of manipulative intelligence

Abstract: Manipulative Intelligence has been classified as a kind of human intelligence which is not amenable to conscious linguistic expression. Examples of what has been classified as manipulative intelligence are the tricks and knack of manipulation and assembly. Attempts to build a system that exhibits manipulative intelligence using the knowledge-based approach has been unsuccessful. At Edinburgh, the focus is to investigate such intelligence through building an intelligent assembly system based on a hybrid symbolic/behaviour-based approach. The first successful system accomplished was the SOMASS system which is capable of planning a large variety of soma parts assemblies and performing them reliably despite the presence of considerable uncertainty. Further development was carried out by adding different types of sensor to the SOMASS system. The sensors used were active mobile vision of force or tactile sensing. These systems were implemented successfully, which proved that a hybrid symbolic/behaviour-based system could be an alternative approach to building a manipulative intelligent system.

Title: Using regression trees to learn action models

Abstract: Anyone who has ever driven a car on an icy road is aware of the impact the environment can have on our actions. In order to build effective plans, we must be aware of these environmental conditions and predict the effects they will have on our ability to act. We present an application of regression trees that allows a robot to learn action models through experience so that it can make similar predictions. We use this approach to allow a mobile robot to learn models to predict the effects of its navigation actions under various terrain conditions and use them in order to produce efficient plans.

Title: An error reference plane of an adaptive controller for a SCARA manipulator

Abstract: We study and design an adaptive nonlinear mixed mode controller, focusing on a new reference plane. Its global asymptotic stability with respect to a nonlinear system: a SCARA robot, is theoretically and experimentally proved. The effectiveness of the proposed error reference planes is verified. Our state adaptation algorithm, modeled by using state errors, is able to change characteristics and configuration of each operating point. The experimental results clearly indicate the performance in fast tracking and converging zero of adaptive plane, derivative plane and integral plane.

Title: The study of missing point in GM(1,1) model

Abstract: We use the class ratio theorem in grey system theory as a new approach for interpolation for a sequence which is incomplete in the GM(1,1) model. First, the class ratio theorems are presented in detail. Second, according to the class ratio theorem, two kinds of sequences in which there is one missing point are fully discussed, and we use the new approach to build up the criteria to find the missing point in the sequence. Finally two examples are given to show that our method is quite reasonable for finding the missing point in the GM(1,1) model.

Title: The selection model of pavement material via grey relational grade

Abstract: In road engineering asphalt concrete is the major material used in the pavement. In the past two decades, only two methods have been used to evaluate the pavement performance. The two methods used are the present serviceability index (PSI) and the present serviceability rating (PSR). If we want to know the effect of each material in detail, then we must establish a different kind of method for our purpose. Therefore, we present the grey theory method for pavement material analysis. First, we consider the characteristics of pavement material. Second, we use the grey relational grade and GM model in grey theory to build up an evaluation model for the analysis of the effect of pavement material on road quality. Finally, an example is given to show that our method is a suitable method in the preference evaluation of pavement material in road quality.

Title: A data-driven approach for supporting extension processing

Abstract: Extension processing (Cai, 1999) has been developed and studied for solving contradictory problems in the real world. Due to the huge amount of computing power needed in the extension, it is important to develop a higher performance scheme for supporting extension processing. In this paper, a data-driven (Gandiot et al., 1996; Nikhl et al., 1992) approach to support the parallel processing of matter elements in an extension system is presented. According to the nature of matter elements, divergent, conjugate, correlative, and implicative, the related attributes can be derived and found efficiently through the proposed data-driven mechanism. In the data-driven execution model, any operation with needed operands available is ready to fire. Those attributes are deemed as the operands needed by the operation, execution is ready to fire as long as the operands are available. Therefore, a higher performance and throughput can be achieved. The evaluation of the scheme is developed and tested according to the requirement of the extension process. From the simulation results, the proposed scheme and associated architecture can provide an effective environment for Extenics.

Title: A linguistic computation model for fuzzy evaluation system

Abstract: In situations such as multicriteria decision making or performance appraisal, linguistic values such as good, poor, or fair are usually used to represent results of evaluation. To grasp the vagueness of linguistic values, fuzzy numbers are introduced to represent uncertainties. Usually, input and output of the evaluation system for the fuzzy environment are fuzzy numbers. However, if the final results of the overall evaluation are represented by fuzzy numbers, it would be difficult to understand for ordinary people. We propose a linguistic computation model for performance evaluation, which takes linguistic values as input, computes on linguistic values and outputs results in terms of linguistic values.

Title: Identification of fuzzy system based on gray relation

Abstract: We propose a new gray relational measurement whose gray relational coefficient is called the gray relational coefficient of order k. Gray relational coefficient of order 1 is the traditional gray relational coefficient. With this new gray relational measurement, we can compute the gray relational matrix of order k for variables of systems. If k is large enough, the matrix would show the clusters of variables and the result is objective.

Title: Nonlinear tracking control for a lightweight flexible robot

Abstract: A robust nonlinear approach to the trajectory tracking control for a lightweight flexible robot manipulator is presented. On the basis of an approximated finite-dimensional nonlinear model, the proposed control law is derived using sliding mode techniques. For the purpose of experimental comparison, we present additionally a two-time scale controller derived using singular perturbation methods. The performance of the presented tracking controllers is demonstrated by experiments carried out with the flexible robot arm, an experimental setup available in our Institute Laboratory.

Title: A new fuzzy ranking method based on fuzzy preference relation

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new fuzzy preference relation for fuzzy ranking, such that it is easy to compute and such that the uncertainty of fuzzy numbers can be maintained during the computation. Our ranking method is a good one since it possesses the following properties: (1) fuzzy preference presentation; (2) rationality of preference ordering; (3) robustness; (4) efficiency.

Title: Using extension theory to design a fast data processing model

Abstract: With the advent of the Internet and WWW in the late 1990s, intelligent systems have found another application area. In the Internet-based system, how to search for the desired information in a short time is very important for the agent, search engine and data mining systems. Thus, we try to design an intelligent system with the characteristics of low complexity, quick convergence and low output error for both academia and industry. We use grey relational analysis to select more important input variables to establish a simplified fuzzy model. Then, we exploit the concepts of extension theory to adjust the fuzzy model during the parameter identification to expedite the tuning process. Finally, the proposed extension-based fuzzy model is applied to implementing an intelligent information retrieval system for the search engine to stress the model's applicability.

Title: Auto-tuning procedure for model-based predictive controller

Abstract: Predictive control has received much attention from both theoreticians and practitioners in diverse fields. However, a challenging problem we must face is how to auto-tune the parameters of the predictive controller. So far, only a few guidelines related to tuning of the parameters of predictive controllers have been provided by the literature. In fact, these parameters are generally determined by the designer's experience. From the process control point of view, it is difficult to find out the optimal parameters for the control system based on the single quadratic performance index. In this paper, attempts are first made to introduce an existing basic predictive control strategy in order to arrive at a best tuning procedure. Later, several multi-objective optimization techniques are explored for the possibility of auto-tuning in model-based predictive control. Finally, the paper presents a predictive controller auto-timing procedure based on the developed recursive multi-objective optimization algorithm and simulate the properties of the scheme.

Title: Dynamic modeling of hydroturbine generating set

Abstract: Regulating the frequency and load is generally undertaken by the hydroturbine generating set in an electric power system. Therefore, it is important for the hydroturbine generating set to operate safely and steadily, and it is necessary to study the dynamic behavior so as to design the control strategy effectively and realize safe and stable operation. This paper mainly discusses the dynamic behavior modeling of a real machine set under the status of a single machine set with region load according to the field test with a recursive least squares estimation (RLSE) algorithm. The results demonstrate that the hydroturbine generating set has nonlinear characteristics on the status of a single machine set with a region load. It will take the error with the linear model to describe their behavior. The paper also studies the nonlinear model with an artificial neural network and it is proved that its modeling accuracy is high.

Title: Adaptive control of heterogeneous ad hoc networks

Abstract: Heterogeneous ad hoc networks are proposed as a solution to the scalability problem in pure ad hoc networks. Some of the links in such a network have much longer wireless transmission ranges (at least in some of their channels) than the other links. Simple systems approaches are studied for adaptive operation and performance optimization of such networks. Our study includes the following: use of very simple functions of observed performance for adaptive control; an example of an operational constraint imposed by a higher layer in the network. Traffic to a destination can be multiplexed over either long range links or over short range links, but not both; and multiple criteria fuzzy decision making. Some of our approaches are illustrated with simulation experiments on a heterogeneous ad-hoc network fielding synthetic self-similar (bursty) traffic.

Title: Improving quasi-optimal inventory and transportation policies using adaptive critic based approximate dynamic programming

Abstract: We demonstrate the possibility of optimal control of physical inventory systems in a nonstationary fitness terrain, based on the combined application of evolutionary search and adaptive critic terrain following. We show that adaptive critic based approximate dynamic programming techniques based on plant-controller Jacobeans can be used with systems characterized by discrete valued states and controls. Improvements upon a quasi-optimal policy found using a genetic algorithm in a high-penalty environment, average 66% under conditions both of stationary and non-stationary demand.

Title: Analysis and feedback control of LonWorks-based network systems for automated manufacturing

Abstract: As the interest in flexible manufacturing systems and computer integrated manufacturing systems increases, the distribution of centralized control systems using industrial control networks is becoming more interesting. We investigate the rate-based traffic control of industrial control networks to improve the performance regarding the throughput fairness and error rates. Especially, we consider the protocol of LonWorks(TM) which consists of all OSI 7-layers and supports various communication media with low cost. Basically, the proposed rate-based traffic control system is closed loop by utilizing the feedback channel errors, which shows improved performance compared with other industrial control networks commonly operating in an open loop. To do this, an additional network node, called the monitoring node, is introduced to check the channel status without increasing the channel load. The proposed control loop is in effect whenever the feedback channel error becomes greater than an admittable value. We demonstrate the improved performance of the controlled network system in view of throughput and fairness measures by implementing the lab-scale network system and through the experimentation upon it.

Title: Nonlinear model predictive control utilizing a neuro-fuzzy predictor

Abstract: This paper applies a quasi-ARMAX modeling technique, presented in the literature, to a process control framework. The use of this quasi-ARMAX modeling technique in nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) formulations applied to simple nonlinear process control examples is investigated. The quasi-ARMAX predictor can be interpreted as a neuro-fuzzy predictor, and this neuro-fuzzy predictor is computationally straightforward and has shown excellent prediction capabilities. The predictor is thus well suited for NMPC purposes. Furthermore, the parameters of the neuro-fuzzy model can be argued to have explicit meaning, thus making the procedure of tuning the NMPC system more transparent when using the neuro-fuzzy predictor.

Title: Observer-based multimodel control

Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to improve the robustness of the multimodel control of discrete systems by using observers. The new strategy of the multimodel control is based on the use of a dynamic library of generic models and observers. The main idea of this paper is to re-initialize the state of each model by the corresponding state estimated from the process when the error between them exceeds a certain value. A good choice of the observer besides a fusion applied on the coefficients of each controller allows the multimodel control strategy to reach the desired objective for the global control of the system. The desired performance is reached by the use of this new strategy of multimodel control. Then, the breakthrough aspect of this work is the introduction of observers in the multimodel control as a technique to improve the validity of the generic models. The global control obtained by this new strategy of control is presented. Computer simulation results show that a design of robust multimodel control based on a good selection of the models plus re-initialization steps based on observers is feasible and provides good performance.

Title: Control optimization for high performance system

Abstract: A regular approach for realizing high performance industrial or technical systems rests upon the development of better performing components with a controller acting with its specific features. As this implies the mastery of a larger frequency domain than the present coverage of actuators, robustification of controllers is required, as for modern ones with improvement over classical PID to better split the frequency band into a lower range for power input and a high gain for performance, and a higher range with small gain for robustness. However, as stability is only simple, the limit is often reached for moderate performance even with high quality components for partly known and/or intrinsically too noisy systems, where performance level and power requirement cannot be simultaneously met. Reassessing the problem, another controller giving asymptotic stability is proposed, and further improvement by distributing the controller's location in an optimum design view of the system is analyzed on a general nonlinear split n-dimensional dynamical system.

Title: Modeling and nonlinear control of a switched reluctance motor to minimize torque ripple

Abstract: This paper proposes a nonlinear model to characterize a 10/8 switched reluctance motor (SRM) in terms of Fourier series expression of phase self-inductance under the assumption of negligible mutual effect and various losses. It introduces a torque ripple minimization method by means of indirect dynamic torque control, then describes the corresponding control conception based on a torque controller (for regulating phase reference current) and a fuzzy logic controller (for adjusting turn-on and turn-off angles). Simulation results have shown the feasibility of the developed approach to minimize the torque ripple.

Title: Decentralized adaptive predictive control of multi-reach irrigation canal

Abstract: This paper presents the design of a predictive controller for decentralized control of an irrigation canal. The overall canal is decomposed into N subsystems (reaches) separated by the control structure (gate). The subsystems are interdependent because flow through the structures depends on both the upstream and downstream water level. In this paper, predictive control theory is used to formulate a set of local controllers for the automatic operation of each reach gate. The control scheme presented explicitly takes into account the interactions among subsystems. The objective of each controller is to maintain the downstream end water level of each reach at a constant target value under external perturbation. To evaluate the controller performance in realistic conditions, it is tested on an open-canal flow nonlinear model. The case study considered deals with 8 canal reaches.

Title: The equivalence of LTI iterative learning control and feedback control

Abstract: Iterative learning control (ILC) improves the accuracy of a system that repeatedly tracks a reference trajectory. If certain convergence conditions are satisfied, the tracking error tends toward some ultimate error signal as the number of iterations grows. We show that for any causal LTI ILC, there exists a feedback control that, achieves an error arbitrarily close to the ultimate ILC error (in a single iteration). This feedback control requires no knowledge of the plant and can be constructed from the ILC parameters alone. This result is obtained even if the ILC algorithm itself includes feedback. Two cases are considered, corresponding to whether or not a certain transfer function matrix is singular. The nonsingular case is investigated for MIMO systems and it is proved that feedback control achieves the ultimate ILC error exactly. For the singular case, it is proved that feedback control can make the tracking error arbitrarily small in the SISO case. The results of this study suggest that ILC provides no benefit over conventional feedback control, even when no plant knowledge is available.

Title: Development of a decentralized robust controller for uncertain large-scale systems with control delays

Abstract: This paper presents a decentralized robust controller design for a class of interconnected dynamic systems with control delays and parametric uncertainties. The parameter uncertainties are considered to be unknown but norm-bounded. By applying Lyapunov's stability theorem, two new delay-dependent sufficient conditions are established in terms of linear matrix inequalities, and linear memoryless state feedback controllers are designed to maintain the robust stability for the class of systems under study. It is shown that either no tuning procedure is required or only one parameter from each inequality needs to be tuned. Two examples are presented to demonstrate the application of the results presented.

Title: Windmill power systems controller design using H/sup /spl infin// theory

Abstract: In this paper, a mixed sensitivity weighting strategy for H/sup /spl infin// controller design for an induction generator/infinity bus windmill power system is presented. The approach is based on a form of quasi-linearization which makes the windmill power system a linear function of the control input. The system controller is then synthesized by using H/sup /spl infin// standard controller design techniques. A combination of additive and multiplicative uncertainty representation is used to achieve the robust stability for a wide range of operating conditions. The capability of the proposed controller to damp out the oscillations of the power and angular velocity, and the robustness with respect to the system parameter variations and model errors are evaluated in the simulation study.

Title: Robust analysis and synthesis for delayed systems with rank-1 type uncertainties

Abstract: This paper deals with the problem of robust stability analysis and synthesis for systems with rank-1 type uncertainties and multiple state delays. A new delay-dependent criterion is presented for the stability of unforced nominal delayed systems. Based on the obtained criterion, a new linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach is developed for the robust stabilization of a class of uncertain delayed systems via a linear memoryless state feedback control law. The results are dependent on the size of the delays and are given in terms of LMIs. The presented method does not require a tuning procedure for scalars and/or matrices and produces results that are less conservative than delay-independent results. Finally, two illustrative examples are presented.

Title: Identification of non-linear dynamic systems with decomposed fuzzy models

Abstract: This paper presents an approach which is useful for the identification of discrete non-linear dynamic systems based on fuzzy relational models. Fuzzy systems are characterized by a rule-base specification. If the complexity of a rule-base increases, knowledge acquisition may become tedious because the number of rules increases with an increasing number of fuzzy variables. Decomposed fuzzy models are proposed and applied to dynamic systems modeling. The evolution of the identification algorithms for the decomposed fuzzy model is suggested. A comparative study of the dynamic system identification with the conventional relational model and the decomposed relational model is presented for a well-known identification problem, namely the Box-Jenkins gas furnace data.

Title: Relaxed stability conditions for Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy systems

Abstract: This paper discusses conditions on stability and stabilization of continuous T-S fuzzy systems. Stability analysis is derived via a non-quadratic Lyapunov function technique and LMIs (linear matrix inequalities) formulation to obtain an efficient solution. The non-quadratic Lyapunov function is built by inference of quadratic Lyapunov function of each local model. We show that the stability condition of the open-loop T-S systems is assured under certain restrictions on the rate of change of state variables. Following a similar approach, the stabilization of closed-loop continuous T-S fuzzy systems using the well-known PDC (parallel distributed compensation) technique is investigated. The design methodology is illustrated by numerical examples.

Title: A novel behavior fusion method for the navigation of mobile robots

Abstract: This paper presents a novel Behavior Fusion method for the navigation of Autonomous Mobile Vehicle in unknown environments. The proposed navigator consists of an Obstacle Avoider (OA), a Goal Seeker (GS) and a Navigation Supervisor (NS). The fuzzy actions inferred by the OA and the GS are weighted by the NS using the local and global environmental information and fused through fuzzy set operation to produce a command action, from which the final crisp action is determined by defuzzification. Simulation shows that the navigator is able to perform successful navigation task in various unknown environments, and it has smooth action and exceptionally good robustness to sensor noise.

Title: Neuro-fuzzy based vector field model: an unified representation for mobile robot guiding styles

Abstract: The development of autonomous robot navigation systems has been a challenge for robot specialists for decades. Different guiding or navigation styles are required for autonomous robots to operate in the intelligent space efficiently and safely under different situations. In this paper an extension of the classical potential based guiding model is presented. The vector field based guiding model is proposed as a unified representation for guiding style model to be used in intelligent space. Simulations have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed guiding style model and its neuro-fuzzy realization.

Title: Analysis of current cycle error assisted iterative learning control for discrete nonlinear time-varying systems

Abstract: Iterative learning control (ILC) is a simple and effective method for the control of systems that perform same task repetitively. In this paper, a current cycle error assisted ILC scheme for a class of discrete nonlinear time-varying systems is presented. Under a few reasonable assumptions, sufficient conditions for guaranteeing the convergence of the learning scheme are given and then proved by an inductive method. It is shown that the conditions are independent of the specific form of the state space model. Finally, some simulation results are given to illustrate the new control strategy.

Title: Wavelet neural network based predictive control for mobile robots

Abstract: This paper presents a predictive control scheme for mobile robots that possess complexity, non-linearity and uncertainty. A multi-layer back-propagation neural network is employed as a model for nonlinear dynamics of the robot. The control variables are produced by optimizing the performance index on-line using the steepest gradient descent algorithm. The neural network is constructed by the wavelet orthogonal decomposition to form a wavelet neural network that can overcome the problems caused by local minima of optimization. The wavelet network is also helpful to determine the number of the hidden nodes and the initial value of weights. The sparse train data in our path tracking case can reduce the effect of the "curse of dimensionality" on the network size in high dimensional function learning caused by the orthogonal wavelet base function.

Title: Coordinated control for free-flyer space robots

Abstract: Robots exploitation for hazardous space environment is challenging the planetary missions, and will have a special role in the assembly and maintenance of International Space Station. In orbit support of extra vehicular activities (EVA), automatic object recognition and manipulation on planets, will enable space robots more and more to substitute astronauts and time delayed teleoperation. Robust and reliable applications of free-flyer space robots are mainly characterized by the dynamic coupling between the motion of the arm and the drift of the spacecraft. Attitude modification is highly undesirable for tracking or manipulation tasks with accuracy, for directional antennas misalignment and for EVA performed close to manned space vehicles. In order to compensate the spacecraft attitude induced motions or to regulate the attitude at a fixed value, the proposed coordinated control exploits both coupled dynamics of the spacecraft-manipulator system and nonholonomic constraint due to angular momentum.

Title: Sonar behavior-based fuzzy control for a mobile robot

Abstract: This paper describes how fuzzy control can be applied to a sonar-based mobile robot. Behavior-based fuzzy control for HelpMate behaviors was designed using sonar sensors. The fuzzy controller provides a mechanism for combining sensor data from all sonar sensors which present different information. The behavior-based approach is implemented as an individual high priority behavior. The highest level behavior is called the task-oriented behavior, which consists of two subtasks, wall following and goal seeking. The middle level behavior is obstacle avoidance. The lowest level is an emergency behavior. Each behavior was built as an atomic agent based on the intelligent machine architecture (IMA). The results demonstrate that each behavior works correctly. The HelpMate robot can follow the wall, go to the goal, and avoid obstacles detected by the sonar sensors.

Title: Fuzzy-rough nearest neighbors algorithm

Abstract: In this paper the classification efficiency of the conventional K-nearest neighbors algorithm is enhanced by exploiting the fuzzy-rough uncertainty. The simplicity and nonparametric characteristics of the conventional K-nearest neighbors algorithm remain intact in the proposed algorithm. Unlike the conventional one, the proposed algorithm does not need to know the optimal value of K. Moreover, the generated class confidence values, which are interpreted in terms of the fuzzy-rough ownership values, do not necessarily summed up to one. Consequently, the proposed algorithm can distinguish between equal evidence and ignorance, and thus makes the semantics of the class confidence values richer.

Title: Control of intelligent agent systems (robots) using extended soft computing

Abstract: Recently, researches on group robot systems (multi-agent intelligent robots: MAIR) have been reported, where a number of robots behave in a group like birds or ants. It is generally known that each robot has a limited intellectual power, but the robots can behave more intellectually in a group because they can interact each other. It has been reported that the multi-agent robot systems which can do many kinds of tasks efficiently by training the rules between environments and actions using reinforcement learning. Intelligent agent systems are also applied to decision making, human interface, perception and others even in a robot system (intelligent function agent robot: IFAR). This paper first introduces extended soft computing (ESC) which is the fusion/combination of fuzzy, neuro, genetic and chaotic computings and immune network theory in order to explain, what they call, complex systems and cognitive and reactive AIs. Then, contemporary intelligent system concept is discussed while the ESC is promising to realize it. Finally, a decision making robot with multi-agents (antigens and antibodies of immune networks), fuzzy inference and reinforcement learning (genetic computing) is described, as an example. It is confirmed that the ESC plays an important role in constructing intelligent robots.

Title: Using one bit wave memory for mobile robots' new sonar-ring sensors

Abstract: This research aims at development of sensors for small size indoor mobile robots. We have proposed a new sonar-ring which can measure accurate direction and distance to reflecting points rapidly for this purpose. This new sonar-ring needs to receive echo signal by multiple receivers and to detect multiple Time-of-Flights (TOFs) in received signal at each receiver simultaneously for achieving fast and accurate measurement. However, it is impossible to satisfy them by conventional circuit. This paper proposes 30 channel 1 bit wave memory system to achieve these two points simultaneously and shows its usefulness.

Title: Forecasting time series using logical combinations of neural-based networks

Abstract: Forecasts are the basis for planning and decision making. The more accurate the organization's forecasts, the better prepared it will be to take advantage of future opportunities and to reduce potential risks. Thus, it should come as no surprise that there is a tremendous number of statistical prediction algorithms already in existence. However, most of them are useful only when the time series exhibit little trend or seasonal variations but a great deal of irregular or random variation. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to propose a new intelligent forecasting technique which is constructed by combining n-trained neural-based network together. The experimental results based on simulated data show a significant improvement in forecasting accuracy.

Title: On evaluation of clustering using homogeneity analysis

Abstract: Proposes a new technique to evaluate the results of fuzzy clustering. Fuzzy clustering is a method to obtain "natural groups" from given observations by using the assumption of a fuzzy subset on clusters. By this method, we can obtain the "degree of belongingness" of an object to a cluster, i.e. each object can belong to several clusters with several degrees, and the boundaries of the clusters become uncertain. However, such clustering sometimes causes confusion when trying to understand the clustering behavior, because the clusters are not exclusive, so each cluster has its own property of mixing with other clusters. Sometimes, a very mixed cluster is created, which makes it difficult to interpret the results. In this case, we need to evaluate the cluster homogeneity in the sense of the degree of belongingness. So, in this paper, I propose an evaluation technique for the results of fuzzy clustering using homogeneity analysis. Several numerical examples demonstrate the validity of this method.

Title: Construction of a dialog system with emotions for elderly persons by neural networks

Abstract: We have developed an interactive system with a dialog function that can analyze the emotions of a user and respond to him/her with facial expressions. The dialog system is based on our "emotion generating calculations" (EGC) method, which is based on C.D. Elliot's (1992) emotion-eliciting condition theory. The proposed method can judge whether an event is pleasant or not and obtain each attribute value for 20 various emotions under that paricular situation. Successfully, we consider adjectival relations and adverbial phrases, and we input their attributes into the EGC, such that we can evaluate the strength of each emotion. This system can depict the face according to the context of the conversation. Although each attribute value in the EGC shows one aspect of feeling, we must integrate those attributes to express human-like emotions. We applied a fuzzy reasoning model for selecting the face, as proposed by T. Yamashita (2000). In this method, nine faces with three levels of eye and eyebrow deflection and three levels of mouth deflection were used to construct the fuzzy reasoning model. In this study, we extended Yamashita's system of eight emotions to a sophisticated system with 20 emotions by means of a neural network.

Title: Mining fuzzy functional dependencies from quantitative data

Abstract: Present a data mining method for discovering fuzzy functional dependencies from quantitative data. A number of algorithms for mining functional dependencies from a crisp relational data model have been proposed recently. The concept of functional dependency is based on the assumption that data are either fully dependent or fully independent. However, this assumption is too restrictive for real-world applications. Our paper thus proposes a method to extract fuzzy functional dependencies from quantitative data. The dependencies discovered contain not only the conventional functional dependencies but also semantic dependencies between attributes. The discovered dependencies call be used in the reconstruction of the conceptual structure of relations and applied further to the integration of knowledge bases and databases as well as reverse engineering.

Title: Neural networks for text-to-speech phoneme recognition

Abstract: Presents two different artificial neural network (ANN) approaches for phoneme recognition for text-to-speech applications: staged backpropagation neural networks and self-organizing maps. Several current commercial approaches rely on an exhaustive dictionary approach for text-to-phoneme conversion. Applying neural networks to phoneme mapping for text-to-speech conversion creates a fast distributed recognition engine. This engine not only supports the mapping of missing words in the database, but it can also mitigate contradictions related to different pronunciations for the same word. The ANNs presented in this work were trained based on the 2,000 most common words in American English. Performance metrics for the 5,000, 7,000 and 10,000 most common words in English were also estimated to test the robustness of these neural networks.

Title: A hybrid algorithm for structure identification of neuro-fuzzy modeling

Abstract: The problems with which we are often confronted in neuro-fuzzy modeling are how to adequately decide the number of fuzzy rules extracted from a set of input-output data and how to precisely define the membership functions of each fuzzy rule. In this paper, we propose a hybrid algorithm that can automatically extract fuzzy rules from a set of numerical data points. Our algorithm is mainly composed of two phases, viz. data partitioning and rule extraction. In the first phase, the data set is partitioned into several clusters according to the similarities between the data points. In other words, the nearby data points are grouped into the same cluster. This is completed by a sequence of combinations of movable fuzzy prototypes. In the second phase, a fuzzy IF-THEN rule is extracted from each cluster and the membership functions of the corresponding rule are determined by statistical techniques. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm converges quickly and can generate fewer rules with a lower mean-square error.

Title: A fuzzy self-organizing map neural network for market segmentation of credit card

Abstract: To date, the proposed clustering analysis methods are tremendous. In most of the methods, however, human-made determinations, such as the number of clustering groups, should be decided previously. Not only is the result affected by the subjective viewpoint of the decision-maker, but also the clustering efficiency is not good enough. To overcome these drawbacks, this research attempts to combine fuzzy set theory with the unsupervised learning network model to create an unsupervised fuzzy self-organizing map (FSOM) model. This model integrates an artificial neural network with fuzzy set theory to take respective advantages of the learning function and the capability of handling uncertainty problems in human recognition processes. Generally, the fuzzy clustering analysis model developed in this research can completely explain the results from experiments. In addition, this model seems more useful and practical than other clustering methods. The integration of FSOM and backpropagation neural networks to establish an intelligent decision support system can improve the problem of being unable to quickly analyze new customer information and effectively respond by making a suggestion to the decision-maker.

Title: Efficient mining of categorized association rules in large databases

Abstract: A number of studies have been made on discovering association rules in a large database due to the wide applications. The common goal of the studies focused on finding the associated occurrence patterns between all items in a database. In practice, mining the association rules with the granularity as fine as a single item could result in a huge number of rules that are too large to utilize efficiently. In practical applications, the users may be more interested in the associations between the categories the items belong to. In this paper, we propose a new method for mining categorized association rules efficiently by using compressed feature vectors. With the proposed method, at most one scan of the database is needed to produce the categorized association rules in each user query, even under different mining parameters. Furthermore, the calculation time during the mining process is also reduced greatly by using only simple logic operations on feature vectors. Hence, the overall performance in mining categorized association rules could be improved substantially.

Title: A new fuzzy PID-like controller

Abstract: A new fuzzy PID-like controller is developed. This controller is basically composed of two independent fuzzy controllers. The proportional and derivative characteristics of the PID controller are mainly performed by the first fuzzy controller, and the second fuzzy controller then displays the integrative characteristic of the PID controller. To demonstrate the advantages of the controller we have developed, several complex nonlinear systems are implemented by using both an ordinary PID controller and our PID-like controller. The PID-like controller we propose has the best control performance.

Title: Model theory for fuzzy logic in the foundations of soft computing

Abstract: We argue that model theory for fuzzy logic, if developed closely to the motivations of the fuzzy approach, can be considered a firm base for soft computing (esp. for fuzzy relational modeling). We present some basic concepts and results concerning similarity issues and morphisms. The results are applied to selected models of fuzzy relational modeling.

Title: Application of soft computing methods to the diagnosis and prediction of glaucoma

Abstract: Artificial intelligence, including fuzzy logic, is applied to the diagnosis of glaucoma. Current methods and difficulties are reviewed and a diagnostic and prediction system is proposed. Validation of the developed software will involve data collected from the clinical evaluation of glaucoma patients, glaucoma-suspect patients and normal subjects. The proposed system is expected to lead to a decrease in the difficulty and cost of glaucoma diagnosis as well as a decrease in the associated health risks.

Title: A self-constructed radial basis function neural network and its applications

Abstract: A method of generating various shapes of kernel functions, such as rectangular shapes and Gaussian-like shapes, for constructing neural networks is proposed. Our method can dynamically adjust the kernel shapes to match the desired output. For example, a kernel function of rectangular shape can be generated for a desired output which has a constant value for some interval. Determination of the initial prototypes may greatly affect the performance of neural networks. Most papers use trial-and-error methods to determine the initial prototypes. We incorporate the ART algorithm to construct the initial prototypes of neural networks. We also define a measure based on entropy theory to detect the local shape of the desired output. The goal of the measurement is to generate suitable kernel shapes. Therefore, there is a critical difference between traditional methods and ours. In other words, our scheme can construct proper shapes, nodes and initial weights automatically. Experimental results show that our method has a better performance than traditional methods.

Title: Fuzzy information processing with neural networks

Abstract: During recent years, fuzzy neural networks have found extensive applications in numerous engineering areas. It is known that the fusion of neural networks and fuzzy logic can overcome their individual drawbacks and benefit from each other's merits. However, current fuzzy neural networks often have complex structures and training algorithms. In addition, some of them cannot deal with fuzzy knowledge directly. Inspired by the alpha-level cut representation of fuzzy numbers, we propose a simple neural network-based approach for processing fuzzy information. By numerical simulations, our scheme is illustrated to be capable of coping with fuzzy input and output without a need for new network topology or learning algorithm

Title: Using fuzzy integral to modeling case based reasoning with feature interaction

Abstract: The guiding principle of case-based reasoning (CBR) is the CBR-hypothesis which assumes that "similar problems have similar solutions". This principle requires a model to compute the problem-similarity in terms of individual features. One frequently used model is to consider the weighted average of feature-similarities as an overall similarity measure. Due to some inherent interaction among diverse features, the weighted average model does not work well in many real-world problems. This paper proposes using a non-linear integral tool to address such a problem. Five fuzzy integrals with respect to a fuzzy measure or a nonadditive set function are discussed in this paper. The interaction among the features is considered to be reflected in the non-additive set function, and the overall similarity is computed by using the integral model instead of using the weighted average model. Because the weighted average can be regarded as a special case of nonlinear integral, this paper to some extent generalizes the application scope of traditional CBR techniques based on similarity.

Title: An intelligent robotic framework for automated assembly

Abstract: Recent applications of robots for industrial automation have shown significant improvement in manufacturing processes in terms of reducing labor participation, enhancing flexibility, efficiency and quality of the products. However, most applications are limited to point-to-point and noninteractive operations in which the availability of a highly structured setup is a prerequisite. This prompts the vast emergency of researches on intelligent robotics that are aimed to improve the adaptability, flexibility and dexterity so as to enhance the intelligence of industrial robots. This paper investigates the designs of intelligent robotic systems and discusses the proposed criteria required to achieve an intelligent robotic system. A proposed conceptual framework for robotic assembly is then presented that contains two main parts, namely, a robotic state recognizer and a control strategy generator. In addition to these two components, the integration of compliant motion control into the framework will be described. An example of using the proposed framework to develop a robotic assembly system is given.

Title: Adaptive genetic algorithm for on-ramp traffic control

Abstract: This paper provides a method that calculates the optimal control of on-ramp traffic density from the basis of the dynamic estimate of traffic density. The on-ramp traffic control problem is formulated as follows. The problem is being able to find the optimal inflow of each on-ramp, based on the evaluation of an on-ramp and main line traffic density. We consider the on-ramp traffic density as the decision variable, and treat this control problem as the nonlinear optimization problem that maximizes the evaluation function under restrictions. To maximize the evaluation function under the restrictions, we propose an adaptive Genetic Algorithm. The solution candidates for on-ramp traffic density have inequality restrictions. Therefore, we consider gene values as ratio of the inflow traffic density within the limit of inequality restrictions. Moreover, in the proposed method, genetic operations are not performed in series, but they are performed in parallel and are adaptive. As numerical examples, we adapt statistical data (the on-ramp traffic density) and examine whether the proposed method can control the traffic jam.

Title: A design of genetic fog occurrence forecasting system by using LVQ network

Abstract: A transportation development in recent years is quite remarkable. However, poor visibility often cause an accident. Therefore, it is very important to forecast a fog occurrence. In this paper, we propose a scheme to forecast a fog occurrence by using the Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) and a Genetic Algorithm (GA). This scheme forecasts the fog occurrence by the weather data which are provided from the Japan Meteorological Agency. First, the provided data formation are shown. Next, the prediction scheme is described in detail. In this method, input attributes for a LVQ network are selected by real-coded GA to improve forecast accuracy. Furthermore, a partial selection processing in the real-coded GA improves its convergence properties. Finally, in order to show the effectiveness of the proposed prediction scheme, computer simulations are performed.

Abstract: A new technique of fusing genetic algorithms with Fuzzy ARTMAP is proposed. This method selects the appropriate autoregressive model order for EEG signals and consequently classifies these signals into their respective different mental tasks. The experimental results show that this method outperforms other statistical autoregressive model order selection methods like Akaike Information Criterion, Final Prediction Error and reflection coefficient.

Title: Using a neuro-fuzzy technique to improve the clustering based on similarity

Abstract: Although there have been many approaches to fuzzy clustering, the clustering based on a similarity matrix is still a popular technique which performs by means of transforming the similarity matrix into its transitive closure. The clustering performance depends strongly on the similarity matrix in which elements are determined according to a distance metric in many situations. For a given case library in which diverse similarity measures can be defined, different similarity matrixes result in different clustering results. This paper introduces the concept of feature weight and then incorporates this concept into the process of computing similarity between two cases, such that the similarity matrix relies on these feature weights. The purpose of this paper is to improve the clustering performance by adjusting these weights in terms of a neural-fuzzy technique. To learn the feature weights, a neural network is designed for minimizing an objective function. For achieving a local minimum of the objective function, the gradient-descent technique is used to train this network. Several indexes for measuring the quality of a clustering result are defined in this paper to compare the performance.

Title: Computational intelligence based approach for the joint trajectory generation of cooperative robotic systems

Abstract: We discuss here the implementation aspects of recently developed tools of computational intelligence for tackling the issue of joint trajectory generation of a class of multi-joint cooperative robotic systems. This is closely related to the inverse kinematics problem which usually represents a heavy computational burden on the processing power of any complex robotic structure. High nonlinearities, heavy coupling between the degrees of freedom, and time variant configuration of the robot structure heavily contribute to these difficulties. Soft computing techniques have surged in recent years as effective computational tools for emulating the human capabilities when dealing with complex systems. Some of them are used here to synthesize approaches capable of substantially improving solving the inverse kinematics problem for a class of robotic systems and help generating the joint trajectories in a faster way.

Title: System with hybrid fuzzy-conventional PID controller

Abstract: In the paper seven controllers are compared: conventional PID, fuzzy PID, two hybrid fuzzy-conventional, two hierarchic, and adaptive. The hybrid controller uses both signals: output signal of conventional and output signal of fuzzy controller. The first one adds to signals, the second multiply two signals. Sometimes, this solution can be applied, where in the system one have a classic controller, and he look for better control possibility or he use fuzzy microcontroller of "dual logic" type. New concept of adaptive switching controller is introduced.

Title: Exploring dynamic Bayesian belief networks for intelligent fault management systems

Abstract: Systems that are subject to uncertainty in their behaviour are often modelled by Bayesian belief networks (BBNs). These are probabilistic models of the system in which the independence relations between the variables of interest are represented explicitly. A directed graph is used, in which two nodes are connected by an edge if one is a 'direct cause' of the other. However the Bayesian paradigm does not provide any direct means for modelling dynamic systems. There has been a considerable amount of research effort in recent years to address this. We review these approaches and propose a new dynamic extension to the BBN. Our discussion then focuses on fault management of complex telecommunications and how the dynamic Bayesian models can assist in the prediction of faults.

Title: High speed multistage fuzzy hardware architecture for fuzzy logic control

Abstract: This paper presents the design of a High Speed Multistage Fuzzy Hardware (HSMFH) architecture for fuzzy logic control. In multistage fuzzy rules, there are input, intermediate, and output variables. The intermediate variable is found in the then-part of the current inference stage and in the if-part of the next stage. Traditionally, the then-part evaluation takes more inferring time. Our approach to resolve the problem is to pre-compute the fuzzy set operations of the intermediate variables without information loss. In addition, to accelerate the inference speed, only the active fuzzy set operations are inferred in If-module and Then-module by using the access control (like DMA). By using the simulation example with 294 fuzzy rules (245 rules in the first stage and 49 rules in the second stage,) the HSMFH takes 128 clocks with the pre-computation technique for an inference cycle. In other words, in one clock, the HSMFH can infer 2.30 fuzzy rules with the precomputation technique.

Title: Feedback model inspired by biological development to hierarchically design complex structure

Abstract: We propose a new feedback system, the BiDevelopment System-inspired by the development mechanism of Drosophila-and discuss possible computer graphics and data compression applications. Drosophila's development forms complex organs from a fertilized egg by hierarchically diffusing different protein densities roughly among cells during the earlier stages and minutely during the later stages. The proposed system models this mechanism and realizes a hierarchical rough-to-detailed or simple-to-complex design, and vice versa. Unlike many conventional feedback systems, it is possible to embed our intended rough design into the mechanism, which is the most significant feature of the proposed system. We compare the BiDevelopment System to biological development with analogies, explain two example algorithms, create complex images from a simple seed code, and discuss its opposite application, data compression.

Title: A greedy approach to rule reduction in fuzzy models

Abstract: The characteristics of a fuzzy model are frequently determined by the manner in which the rules are constructed. Rules obtained by a heuristic assessment of a system generally are linguistically interpretable and have large granularity. The generation of rules via learning algorithms that analyse training data produces precise models consisting of multiple rules of small grannularity. In this paper, a greedy algorithm is presented that combines rule learning with a region merging strategy to reduce the number of rules. This approach differs from standard rule reduction techniques in that the latter are employed after the rule base has been completed while the learn-and-merge strategy generates a rule simultaneously with expanding its region of applicability. The objective of the algorithm is to produce fuzzy models with both a small number of interpretable rules and high precision.

Title: Simplifying fuzzy rule base of multiple input multiple output systems by constructing multi-layer fuzzy controller

Abstract: In conventional rule based fuzzy control systems, the rules have the form of "IF 
 THEN ." The number of rules increases exponentially as the number of system variables, upon which the fuzzy rules are based, is increased. Some papers have showed that, by structuring the rules in a hierarchical way, the total numbers of rules was a linear function of the system variables. In this paper, it was shown that the number of rules could still be reduced to minimum numbers by employing the same fuzzy rule set at every level.

Title: Monotone fuzzy control method and its control performance

Abstract: For most process controls the relation between the input and the output is of monotonicity. So a question immediately arises as follows: For two precise inputs, say x/spl les/y, can the fuzzy control method guarantee the corresponding crisp outputs preserving the same inequality? Or whether or not the fuzzy control method is of monotone? In this paper, we will focus on the problems mentioned above. Therefore, some new concepts about this topic are proposed, such as the monotone and the rough monotone control algorithm, the monotone rule base and the monotone smooth transition system model, etc. Analysis shows that as long as the rule base is monotone, the single-input single-output conventional Mamdani fuzzy control algorithm (CMFCA for short) is monotone and the two-input single-output CMFCA is rough monotone. Finally, a sufficient condition for monotonicity of the CMFCA is obtained, i.e. if the rule base is monotonic and the universes is partitioned by isosceles triangle fuzzy numbers with base point single resonating, then the two-input single-output conventional Mamdani algorithm is of monotone.

Title: A learning fuzzy system for looper control in rolling mills

Abstract: In this paper, several issues of looper control in rolling mills are discussed and a fuzzy logic control is proposed to address the enumerated issues. The proposed system incorporated fast tuning algorithms for both off-line and online learning of membership functions and singleton values. Also, it is relatively simple to design and implement. The effectiveness of the proposed system is verified by the simulations results. It is shown that the proposed system is more robust to parameter uncertainties and noises, when compared with conventional PID control.

Title: Neuro-fuzzy approach for modeling complex functional mappings

Abstract: Function approximators are needed in lots of applications to model nonlinear functional mappings. Where no formal description exists, computational intelligence methods may be used. But knowledge-based systems suffer from the knowledge engineering bottleneck as well as from the curse of dimensionality if the number of input variables increases. Artificial neural networks can handle such complex applications, but they are a black box-approach. Hence learned knowledge cannot be analyzed or improved manually. In this article the NetFAN-approach (Network of Fuzzy Adaptive Nodes) is described which combines decomposition of a neuro-fuzzy system and learning in order to apply neurofuzzy methods to applications with an increased number of input variables while keeping the advantages of neuro-fuzzy systems like interpretability of learned knowledge. Its applicability as a function approximator is demonstrated by "The Great Energy Predictor Shootout" benchmark problem. In this example, results were achieved which are comparable to the top benchmark candidates.

Title: Establishment of a sliding mode in a nonlinear system by tuning the parameters of a fuzzy controller

Abstract: In this paper, a novel method for the establishment of a sliding mode in a nonlinear system is presented. The method discussed aims to minimize a cost measure, which is a function of the switching surface. For this purpose, an adaptive fuzzy controller is selected and the parameters of the defuzzifier are adjusted such that the cost is minimized and the system is enforced to behave in sliding mode. The paper considers a 2-DOF direct drive robotic manipulator as the test bed and a standard fuzzy system is used as the controller. The results obtained clearly stipulate that a sliding motion can be achieved by appropriately tuning the parameters of the controller.

Title: Game strategy based on fuzzy logic for soccer robots

Abstract: Soccer robot system is a tremendously challenging intelligent system. It is developed to mimic human soccer competition, based on the multi-discipline research: robotics, intelligent control, computer vision, etc. In this multi-robot system, robot path planning strategy is a very important subject concerning to the system's performance and intelligence degree. Therefore, this paper focuses the study on the path planning strategy of soccer system by using fuzzy logic. After setting up two fuzziers and two sorts of fuzzy rules for soccer system, fuzzy logic is applied into two aspects: workspace partition and path revision. The experimental results show that this technique can well enhance the system's performance and intelligence degree.

Title: Relevance as a new measure of relative importance of sets of rules

Abstract: Process modelling is an important discipline both in science and engineering. The complexity of many real world systems has lead to sophisticated modelling approaches, where both the accuracy and readability of the models are of great importance. Fuzzy modelling is such an approach, which uses well-established machine learning techniques, producing models with the capacity of integrating expert knowledge with real world observations. The behaviour of these models is described as a series of linguistic rules. The readability of the models is related to the number of rules used to describe the system. In order to define methodologies for organising the information describing a system, it is important to define metrics for the relative importance of a set of rules in the description of a given region of the input/output space. This paper addresses this problem, and a new concept is proposed: the relevance of a set of rules.

Title: Using OGA in fuzzy based system modeling

Abstract: High performance of fuzzy systems for modeling depends strongly on some parameters such as number of fuzzy partitions, their shapes and characteristics of membership functions. These parameters are usually chosen intuitively or more possibly after some trial-and-errors. This paper presents two techniques using a modified genetic algorithm and Marquardt BP based learning algorithm to improve fuzzy system models by systematically tuning the aforementioned parameters. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique, we employ them to model a synchronous generator. The simulation results are promising.

Title: Extracting fuzzy sparse rules by Cartesian representation and clustering

Abstract: Sparse rule base and interpolation have been proposed as possible solution to alleviate the geometric complexity problem of large fuzzy set. However, no formal method to extract sparse rule base is yet available. This paper combines the recently introduced Cartesian representation of membership functions and a mountain method-based clustering technique for the extraction. A case study is included to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.

Title: A new approach in model selection using fuzzy decision making-a trade off between probability and possibility theories

Abstract: Model selection problem is applied to many various fields of scientific studies, in order to corroborate or verify a theory, or in order to prefer one theory among a set of competing hypothesis. Different criteria are taken as basis to select one model between several parallel models in both statistical and visual types. This paper proposes a new method in model selection based on solution of a Fuzzy Decision-Making (FDM) problem. The method enables the scientist (model builder) to apply all desired validity criteria, even linguistic criteria, systematically by defining a proper Possibility Distribution Function (PDF) due to each criterion. Finally, minimization of a utility function composed of the PDFs will determine the best selection.

Title: Indirect tuning of membership function in a fixed fuzzy structure for efficient control of a DC drive system

Abstract: A novel approach has been developed to tune the parameters of the membership function in a fixed fuzzy logic structure indirectly. The proposed concept is based on integrating the membership values of the input variables for a given linguistic set having a fixed centre but different widths. An arithmetical averaging method is applied to estimate the resultant membership value. This idea resembles that of combining the knowledge of different experts based on their independent assessment analyzing a given problem and then to derive a pseudo-optimal decision for the final action. This work is applied to evaluate the change of firing angle required to control the speed of a seperately excited DC motor drive fed from a phase-controlled converter. The response of the motor is found to be excellent in comparison to conventional fuzzy structure.

Title: A simple weight based fuzzy logic controller rule base reduction method

Abstract: This paper proposes a new rule base reduction method for Takagi-Sugeno type fuzzy logic controller. This method is cell state space based. First, the controller inputs are fuzzified and a generic rule base is built. This rule base includes all the possible combinations of input values. A search algorithm called Incremental Best Estimate Directed Search (IBEDS) is invoked to find the parameters in rule output functions. IBEDS starts with an initial training set. Each point inside the training set represents a currently best estimate control command for a cell center. Then another random FLC is trained in an iterative procedure by a Least Mean Square (LMS) algorithm. In each iteration, the cell state space based global and local performance of the trained FLC are evaluated, the training set is then updated based on the evaluation. When IBEDS converges, the final training set contains the maximal number of cells that a single FLC can control. At this stage, for each rule in the rule base, the firing strength or weight of the rule is calculated with every point from the training set. All the weights are added up to get a final Importance Index for that rule. A designer can cut off the rules with smallest importance indexes. A designer can cut as many rules as wanted according to the importance indexes. An FLC with reduced rule base is optimized by IBEDS again to achieve optimal performance. A 4D inverted pendulum is tested to justify the method. Each of the four inputs is fuzzified into 3 fuzzy values. A generic controller with 81 rules is built. After the optimization, the rule base is reduced to 40, 28, 17, and 5 respectively. The performances of the controllers with different rule bases are compared. It is shown that a controller with only 5 rules can perform comparably well with a controller of 81 rules.

Title: Fuzzy QoS management in Diff-Serv networks

Abstract: The basic objectives for the future for the Internet are to increase network capacity, and to offer practically differentiated services for traffic with different requirements such as real-time and non-real-time services. These objectives introduce very strict requirements for the traffic control system and lead to the establishment of the differentiated services (Diff-Serv). So far, several Diff-Serv schemes have been proposed, and the concepts of drop and delay priorities are explicitly or implicitly discussed in all these schemes. These two priorities are of varying importance to different service requirements, and strongly interrelated. They expose an important issue in the optimization of the Internet. However, the relationship between these two priorities is rarely mentioned and hence it remains an open problem. This paper presents a fuzzy approach to this key but tough issue. Specifically, a differentiated service scheme with feedback preference information (FPI) is studied in more detail to illustrate the implementation of the new approach. Simulation shows that the approach is efficient and promising.

Title: Development of an adaptive neuro-fuzzy method for supply air pressure control in HVAC system

Abstract: An adaptive neuro-fuzzy (ANF) method is developed for the supply air pressure control loop of a heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) system. Although a well-tuned PID controller performs well around normal working points, its tolerance to process parameter variations is severely affected due to the nature of PID controllers. The ANF controller developed overcomes this weakness. The controller design involves 1) the constructing a Takagi and Sugeno-type fuzzy rule-based system, 2) employing the BP learning algorithm combined with the least squares method to optimize the membership function (MF) parameters, and 3) adding a secondary loop to ensure control performance. Compared with PID and original fuzzy logic controllers, simulation results show that the ANF controller performances are comparable to the well-tuned PID controller under normal conditions. It, however, exhibits a much improved robustness when the system encounters large parameter variations. It is also expected that the ANF method developed can be easily extended to other control loops in HVAC systems.

Title: A Takagi-Sugeno type fuzzy logic controller with only 3 rules for a 4 dimensional inverted pendulum system

Abstract: This paper presents a Takagi-Sugeno (TS) type Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) with only 3 rules for a 4 dimensional inverted pendulum system. This controller is able to control the system over a larger range of pole angle and cart positions compared with other control schemes. The rule antecedents of this controller are extracted from a cell state space based Optimal Control Table (OCT) by a subtractive clustering method and the rule output function parameters are optimized by an efficient search algorithm called Incremental Best Estimate Directed Search (IBEDS), which is also cell state space based. Simulation results demonstrate the usefulness of this 3 rule controller.

Title: Improved distributed genetic algorithm with cooperative-competitive genetic operators

Abstract: We have presented an empirical model of genetic algorithms (GA) that puts parallel genetic operators in a cooperative-competitive stand with each other. An improved GA (GA-SRM) based on this model remarkably improves the search performance of a single population GA. We extend GA-SRM to distributed GAs in order to improve the performance of multiple population GAs. Simulation results verify that the parallel genetic operators in GA-SRM, CM and SRM, can successfully contribute to improve the search performance of distributed GAs.

Title: Genetic network programming - application to intelligent agents

Abstract: Recently many studies have been made on the automatic design of complex systems using evolutionary optimization techniques such as genetic algorithms (GA), evolution strategy (ES), evolutionary programming (EP) and genetic programming (GP). It is generally recognized that these techniques are very useful for optimizing fairly complex systems such as the generation of intelligent behavior sequences of robots. A new method, genetic network programming (GNP), is proposed in order to acquire these behavior sequences efficiently. GNP is composed of plural nodes for agents to execute simple judgment/processing and they are connected with each other to form a network structure. Agents behave according to the contents of the nodes and their connections in GNP. In order to obtain a better structure, the GNP changes itself using evolutionary optimization techniques.

Title: Multi-objective optimization with improved genetic algorithm

Abstract: We extend an improved GA (GA-SRM) to the multi-objective flowshop scheduling problem (FSP) in order to obtain better pareto-optimum solutions (POS). Two kinds of cooperative-competitive genetic operators in GA-SRM, CM and SRM, are extended to ones suitable for FSP in which solutions (individuals) are represented as permutations. Simulation results verify that GA-SRM shows better performance for the multi-objective optimization problem (MOP), and consequently better POS are obtained than conventional approaches with canonical GA.

Title: Page-based linear genetic programming

Abstract: Genetic programming arguably represents the most general form of evolutionary computation. However, such generality is not without significant computational overheads. Particularly, the cost of evaluating the fitness of individuals in any form of evolutionary computation represents the single most significant computational bottleneck. A less widely acknowledged computational overhead in GP involves the implementation of the crossover operator. To this end a page-based definition of individuals is used to restrict crossover to equal length code fragments. Moreover, by using a register-machine context, the significance of a priori internal register external output definitions is emphasized.

Title: A development environment for evolutionary robotics

Abstract: Evolutionary robotics is an exciting new area of research with the potential to provide ways to build robots that are beyond our current design abilities. Instead of building robots from the ground up, as with other approaches, robot controllers are evolved using algorithms inspired by biological evolution. The purpose of this work is to develop a tool for the evolution of mobile robot controllers. The controllers are evolved in a realistic simulation. The evolutionary algorithms are provided by the GALib library. Testing demonstrates that the system is capable of producing useful robot controllers. Users can configure the system so that a variety of controller types can be evolved. With a system such as this, users can conduct a range of experiments without having to create custom software.

Title: Behavior evolution of autonomous mobile robot using genetic programming based on evolvable hardware

Abstract: This paper presents a genetic programming based evolutionary strategy for on-line adaptive learnable evolvable hardware. Genetic programming can be a useful control method for evolvable hardware for its unique tree structured chromosome. However it is difficult to represent the tree structured chromosome in hardware, and it is difficult to use the crossover operator in hardware. Therefore, genetic programming is not as popular as genetic algorithms in the evolvable hardware community in spite of its possible strengths. We propose a chromosome representation method and a hardware implementation method that can be helpful for this situation. Our method uses a context switchable identical block structure to implement a genetic tree in evolvable hardware. We compose an evolutionary strategy for evolvable hardware by combining the proposed method with other research results. The proposed method is applied to the autonomous mobile robots cooperation problem to verify its usefulness.

Title: A genetic search method for multi-player game playing

Abstract: It is well known that when exploring a game tree, the deeper the depth, the more accurate the move prediction but greater temporal and spatial expansion is required. How to explore the game tree deeper is a great challenge in such research. In T.P. Hong et al (Int. Conf. on Evolutionary Computation, Anchorage, Alaska, USA, p.690-4, 1998), we proposed a genetic algorithm-based search method for two-player games. In this paper, we generalize that method to solve multi-player game-search problems. We propose a genetic algorithm-based approach that can find good next moves in multi-player games without the requirement for great temporal and spatial expansion.

Title: DNA genetic algorithm for design of the generalized membership-type Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy control system

Abstract: We propose a new DNA-based genetic algorithm (DNA-GA) to optimize the design parameters of a generalized membership-type Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy controller (GTSFC). The GTSFC employs TS fuzzy rules with linear consequent, e/sup -|ax+b|(c)/-type input fuzzy sets containing almost arbitrary continuous input fuzzy sets, Zadeh fuzzy logic AND operation, and the widely-used centroid defuzzier. The GTSFC is proved to be a nonlinear PI controller with variable gains. The optimized design parameters are the input fuzzy sets and the linear consequent of the rules. The DNA-GA uses a DNA encoding method stemmed from the structure of the biological DNA to encode the design parameters of the GTSFC. The genetic operators of the method are based on the DNA genetic operations. The encoding method can significantly shorten the code length of DNA chromosomes and is suitable for complex knowledge representation. As a demonstration, we show how to implement the new method to optimize the design parameters of the GTSFC to control a nonlinear system. Computer simulation results indicate that the performance of the designed fuzzy controller is satisfactory.

Title: Coevolutive adaptation of fitness landscape for solving the testing problem

Abstract: A general framework, called Uniform Coevolution, is introduced to overcome the testing problem in evolutionary computation methods. This framework is based on competitive evolution ideas where the solution and example sets are evolving by means of a competition to generate difficult test beds for the solutions in a gradual way. The method has been tested with two different problems: the robot navigation problem and the density parity problem in cellular automata. In both test cases using evolutive methods, the examples used in the learning process biased the solutions found. The main characteristics of the Uniform Coevolution method are that it smoothes the fitness landscape and, that it obtains "ideal learner examples". Results using uniform coevolution show a high value of generality, compared with non co-evolutive approaches.

Title: The driven genetic selection mechanism

Abstract: This paper defines a new distance measurement for binary strings called the extended Hamming distance. Using this measurement we prove that the binary decoding method in the simple genetic algorithm satisfies the demand of certain continuity. Based on this continuity, we propose a new selection mechanism called the driven selection mechanism. This selection mechanism computes the expected number of copies of each string in the population based on the difference of fitness values between the best string and the current string, i.e. if a string is close to the best string, it has more chance to survive. A distinct improvement of this new selection mechanism is that the impact of the sign of the fitness value disappears, and the comparing experiment verifies that the driven selection mechanism can prevent premature termination more effectively.

Title: Document categorisation by genetic algorithms

Abstract: Today, it is easy to provide information to and retrieve information from the Internet. However, the problem of information overload has to be overcome. One of the main issues to be addressed for the information overload problem is document classification. We present an evolutionary approach to automatically categorize documents into appropriate categories. Our approach deals with different categories of documents separately: it evolves a numerical list that consists of the corresponding weights of the feature words for each class of documents. Experimental results show that our approach can easily evolve the classifiers of numerical lists, and that the evolved classifiers perform better than those constructed by the traditional k-nearest neighbors approach.

Title: Modeling FMS through PN: the modular structural synthesis

Abstract: We provide a formal approach to obtain a discrete event system (DES) representation of a flexible manufacturing system (FMS). The complexity of real FMSs typically yields formidable problems in modeling such systems and in their representation by means of any predefined formalism, for instance Petri nets (PNs). A technique which allows one to obtain the PN from a description of a system is called a synthesis procedure. A synthesis procedure is presented which is based on a modular conception: a generic FMS can be easily divided, from a physical point of view, into a set of connected resources totally independent one from the other. Once such resources have been identified, we represent them by means of a set of independent subnets, the Petri net modules (PNMs), and then we can apply the synthesis procedure. For this reason, the proposed procedure has been called modular structural synthesis.

Title: Face pattern recognition under complex background

Abstract: We propose a practical method for recognizing the face of acquaintance as a subpattern within a given image, even for the cases where the face is in a crowd, or the face image has a complex background. We assume that the face pattern to be recognized approximately equals an affine transformed (rotated, enlarged, reduced, and translated) input image. In order to detect the face pattern and, at the same time, to estimate the parameters of the affine transformation, we use a Karhunen-Loeve (KL) expansion, spatial correlation, and an approximate equation based on Taylor's expansion. Moreover, this method also estimates the parameter of lighting to absorb variations of light. Experimental results show that the method is considerably effective.

Title: Function analysis method of human's motion control system

Abstract: The purpose of this research is to propose a quantitative analysis method to analyze the relationship between the feedforward controller and feedback controller in a motion learning process, and also to assess the effectiveness of this method by experiments. To analyze the mechanisms of the motion control systems, we propose: 1) a control gain identification method, 2) a squared-error separation method, 3) a gradient separation method, and 4) a pattern correlation method. The inverted pendulum is used to evaluate the effectiveness of these methods. Experiments show that the proposed methods are an effective way to separate the motor control system into feedforward control and feedback control. They also disclose the fact that there are two learning processes; one of which mainly performs feedback control and the other mainly feedforward control.

Title: Architecture for Video mapping Development: The Method and the Application in NMSPCAM

Abstract: New media, such as projections using the video mapping technique, are increasingly used in public spectacles, attracting many viewers. However, those video mapping spectacles are highly focused on the special effects and visual appeal, rarely focusing in the art of a visual narrative, with the aim of communicating and diffusing historical knowledge. Interested in the unexplored potential of using this technique, the project established and proposed an Architecture for Video mapping Development (AVmD). It is divided in three parts, comprised of multiple stages and phases, tested during the development of an audiovisual production for a video mapping projection that took place in May 2019, as part of a project. The current article reveals the innovation introduced in the process of the proposed architecture, along with technical details for contents development, concerning storytelling and cultural heritage communication, in the real context of a video mapping project.

Title: Bone age assessment using general use convolutional neural networks

Abstract: Deep Learning methods have been applied to different medical imaging analysis tasks like, e.g., lesion classification and tissue segmentation. Bone age assessment is traditionally performed on an x-ray of the non-dominant hand applying the Greulich and Pyle or the Tanner Whitehouse methods. In this work, we first have tested several state-of-the-art Convolution Neural Networks models for assessing bone age that previously has shown great results in general computer vision tasks. Based on these results, we have developed/optimized a new model, which is presented here. For this purpose, we used transfer learning methods and trained the selected networks from scratch achieving a 7.89-month error rate when assessing bone age in females.

Title: Extended Reality Framework for Remote Collaborative Interactions in Virtual Environments

Abstract: This paper proposes the implementation of a framework for the development of collaborative extended reality (XR) applications. Using the framework, developers can focus on understanding which collaborative mechanisms they need to implement for the respective reality model application. In this paper we specifically study collaborative mechanisms around object manipulation in Virtual Reality (VR). As such, we planned a VR prototype using the proposed framework, which was used to validate the various interaction and collaboration features in VR. The gathered data from the user tests revealed that they enjoyed the experience and the collaborative mechanisms helped them work together. Furthermore, to understand whether the framework allowed for the development of XR applications, we decided to implement an augmented reality prototype as well. Afterwards, we ran an experiment with 4 VR and 3 AR users sharing the same virtual environment. The experiment was successful at allowing them to interact in real-time in the same shared environment. Therefore, the framework enables the development of XR applications that support different mixed-reality technologies.

Title: Correlation between Game Experience and Presence in immersive virtual reality games

Abstract: Virtual Reality (VR) technologies have evolved to the point where it is being used in various areas (entertainment, medicine, education, etc.). One of the metrics that allow the evaluation of the virtual experience is Presence. In this work, we conduct an exploratory study that studies which factors of VR games correlate to presence. Various components of games are also shared between other VR applications allowing the results to be applicable not only in VR games. A study with 78 participants divided into 5 groups was conducted where each group played a different VR game. Presence and Game Experience were evaluated. The results indicated multiple positive correlations between subscales of Presence and Game Experience.

Title: Designing of a mobile app for the development of pervasive games

Abstract: We face a technology growth period that promotes STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) as basic set of competences in diversified professional backgrounds. However, the process of teaching this areas is complex and abstract. We propose using game-based learning (GBL) for increased engagement and efficacy. More specifically, we use pervasive games as the drive of the learning process, promoting challenges in the context of the learner. To develop pervasive games, we require mobile devices (for location-based games) and a set of functionalities regarding location, time, and context of the user. In this article, we present the design of a mobile app to implement pervasive games. The perks of the mobile devices will be used to get unique and engaging challenges, to stimulate learning. Therefore, the learning process will become more enjoyable, and it will accomplish the goal of learning “anytime anywhere”. This work sets upon previous work developed in the H2020 BEACONING project and the mobile app presented will allow other developers to create pervasive games for distinct areas of learning in a more engaging and effective way.

Title: Age and level of education impact on expectancy and perceived similarity between virtual and real touristic environments

Abstract: This paper focuses on the combination of 360-degree video and virtual reality for improving the touristic experience. Three scenarios were considered in this study: two 360-degree video visualizations, each one related to different touristic places, both presented in an immersive way, followed by an actual visit to those places. By comparing these situations, it was intended to determine the degree of perceived similarity between the virtual and the corresponding real sites, and to analyze if the users' expectancy was fulfilled. This research comprised a qualitative analysis using data collection based on questionnaires, which were applied to a sample consisted of 45 participants. The independent variables of the study were the participants' age and level of education. The results show no statistically significant impact between the two independent variables (users'age and level of education) and perceived similarity and users' expectancy. Our findings suggest that virtual tourism can act as an efficient promotion tool, considering that users' perceived destination image is not compromised regarding their age or level of education.

Title: Generic and Reconfigurable Virtual Reality Simulation System

Abstract: Typically, industrial equipment virtual simulators lack flexibility to adapt to new requirements or needs and usually are made with a specific objective in mind. Therefore, there is the need to develop Virtual Reality (VR) simulators with sufficiently dynamic bases so that the training manager can configure and simulate a set of different machines, without needing expensive development processes that usually result in the reformulation of the developed system foundations in order to adapt to new needs. This paper proposes a generic and reconfigurable virtual reality system, capable of simulating the operation of different types of machines and suitable to be used in the training of workers for the operation of the various machines, for instance the ones present in an entire production line. The proposed approach is based on the use of a specification language that describes both the physical and behavioral characteristics of the machines to be simulated. A specification file, written using this language, is fed to the VR simulator that interprets its content and builds, automatically, the corresponding virtual reality environment, which can be used by the trainees to operate the machine(s). This approach allows using the same VR simulator to simulate any machine. A prototype of the VR system was built and applied in a test scenario. The results reveal that the development of systems with dynamic bases is promising and deserving of future work to build a more complete and flexible VR simulation system.

Title: I Am Here!

Abstract: Tracking student's attendance in classrooms has been a problem for the professors for a long time, not only because of the difficulty to guarantee that the student is indeed the room, but also the time it consumes afterwards to manually transcript and validate the data. I Am Here! has the goal of being an innovative automated attendance system that aims to fulfill the existing gaps in this area, with a simple, costless, portable and fraud-resistant system using the Device Fingerprinting technique. A critical aspect was the design of a user interface that made the process as easy as possible for inside and outside the classroom, but at the same time sufficiently complex as to preclude, as much as possible, attempts at fraud. As a case study and form of validation, the system was deployed in a course where 116 students were enrolled, in Técnico Lisboa. The system was submitted to three evaluations: a Classroom Usage Evaluation, a User Evaluation and a Device Fingerprint Evaluation.

Title: Towards Music-Driven Procedural Animation

Abstract: We present our approach towards the development of a framework for the creation of music-driven procedural animations. We intend to explore the potential that elementary musical features hold for driving engaging audio-visual animations. To do so, we bring forward an integrated environment where real-time musical information is available and may be flexibly used for manipulating different aspects of a dynamic animation. In general terms, our approach consists of developing a virtual scene, populated by controllable entities, termed actors, and using scripting to define how these actors' behaviour or appearance change in response to musical information. Scripting operates by establishing associations, or mappings, between musical events, such as the ringing of notes or chords, or sound information, such as the frequency spectrum, and changes in the animation. The scenario we chose to explore is comprised of two main actors: trees and wind. Trees grow in an iterative process, and may develop leaves, while swaying in response to the wind field. The wind is represented as a vector field whose configuration and strength can be altered in real-time. Scripting then allows for synchronising these changes with musical events, providing a natural sense of harmony with the accompanying music. By having real-time access to musical information, as well as control over a reactive animation we believe to have taken a first step towards exploring a novel interdisciplinary concept with vast expressive potential.

Title: A Quantum Algorithm for Ray Casting using an Orthographic Camera

Abstract: Quantum computing has the potential to provide solutions to many problems which are challenging or out of reach of classical computers. There are several problems in rendering which are amenable to being solved in quantum computers, but these have yet to be demonstrated in practice. This work takes a first step in applying quantum computing to one of the most fundamental operations in rendering: ray casting. This technique computes visibility between two points in a 3D model of the world which is described by a collection of geometric primitives. The algorithm returns, for a given ray, which primitive it intersects closest to its origin. Without a spatial acceleration structure, the classical complexity for this operation is O(N). In this paper, we propose an implementation of Grover's Algorithm (a quantum search algorithm) for ray casting. This provides a quadratic speed up allowing for visibility evaluation for unstructured primitives in O(√N). However, due to technological limitations associated with current quantum computers, in this work the geometrical setup is limited to rectangles and parallel rays (orthographic projection).

Title: Inpresso AR: a generic Augmented Book

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) is a technology that enables to show virtual information superimposed on the real world and interact with it. In recent years, this technology has been heavily explored in various contexts, with a focus on enriching the experience provided by smartphones and wearables. AR books techniques consist of adding interactive and immersive properties to physical books, transforming the reading activity into a unique experience. In this paper, it is proposed a generic augmented book that is capable of downloading and playing different AR experiences for any existing book. A hybrid experiences specification schema was defined to characterize the AR experiences. The proposed augmented book application recognizes a book, downloads from the server the experiences specification file associated with it, builds the necessary AR experiences assets and plays them. A prototype was built and some preliminary tests were conducted. The approach described here allows physical books to be connected with remote servers, transforming them into dynamic sources of information and into products much more immersive, interactive and attractive.

Title: VisMillion: A novel interactive visualization technique for real-time big data

Abstract: The rapid increase of connected devices causes more and more data to be generated and, in some cases, this data needs to be analyzed as it is received. As such, the challenge of presenting streaming data in such way that changes in the regular flow can be detected needs to be tackled, so that timely and informed decisions can be made. This requires users to be able to perceive the information being received in the moment in detail, while maintaining the context. In this paper, we propose VisMillion, a visualization technique for large amounts of streaming data, following the concept of graceful degradation. It is comprised of several different modules positioned side by side, corresponding to different contiguous time spans, from the last few seconds to a historical view of all data received in the stream so far. Data flows through each one from right to left and, the more recent the data, the more detailed it is presented. To this end, each module uses a different technique to aggregate and process information, with special care to ensure visual continuity between modules to facilitate the analysis. VisMillion was validated through a usability evaluation with 21 participants, as well as performance tests. Results show that it fulfills its objective, successfully aiding users to detect changes, patterns and anomalies in the information being received.

Title: Designing Collaborative and Coordinated Virtual Reality Training Integrated with Virtual and Physical Factories

Abstract: Rapidly changing customer demands, regulations and technologies drive the complexity of products, processes and production systems, as well as shorter product and factory lifecycles. In order to handle such complexity while decreasing the time-to-market, immersive virtual reality (VR) technologies are increasingly being used in industry to support product and factory lifecycle engineering processes, such as (re)design, validation and verification, learning and training. However, the design and development of multi-user VR training for complex and manual production processes remain a challenge for industry. The integration of VR training simulations with virtual and physical factories could support the handling of such obstacles in terms of efficiency and effectiveness by increasing the precision, accuracy and reliability of data used in VR simulations. In this study, we present a collaborative and coordinated VR training model and its data integration with virtual factory tools and manufacturing execution systems for a wind turbine assembly scenario. A demonstration has been performed and evaluated by industry experts. The preliminary evaluation results show that integrated collaborative VR training has significant potential for more efficient and effective training, as well as enabling new use cases for industry.

Title: Virtual Reality for training - The impact of smell on presence, cybersickness, fatigue, stress and knowledge transfer

Abstract: The area of professional training using virtual reality technologies has received considerable investment due to the advantages that virtual reality provides over traditional training. In this paper, we present an experiment whose goal was to analyse the impact that an additional stimulus has on the effectiveness of a virtual environment designed to train firefighters. The additional stimulus is a smell, more specifically the smell of burnt wood, which is consistent with the audiovisual content presented, and the effectiveness of the VE is measured through participant's feeling of presence, cybersickness, fatigue, stress and transfer of knowledge. The results indicate that, although the VE was successful in transferring knowledge, the addition of smell did not influence any of the measured variables. In the discussion section, we present the various factors that we believe have influenced this result. As future work, more experiments will be performed, with other stimuli, to understand better which stimuli increase participant's feeling of presence in the VE.

Title: Evaluation of different body tracking configurations in the sense of presence and embodiment

Abstract: Innovations in virtual reality have boosted their use for business purposes and personal consumption. The main objective of this technology is to transport the user to virtual environments. The use of avatars to replace the user's body in these environments increases the levels of presence and embodiment of the user. Through the inverse kinematics it is possible to animate the avatars according to the data obtained in sensors scattered around the user's body, replicating the movements in a avatar. These sensors can vary in number offering different levels of fidelity in the tracking of the human body. In this paper, we study the impact of the number of sensors used in the presence of the user and in the embodiment of the avatar, using three, five and six tracking points. The results show that there is no statistically significant differences in presence nor in any of its sub-scale, however one can observe a positive trend in the 6-points conditions. As for embodiment, the results show that there is statistically signifficant differences in some of presence sub-scales, namelly tactile sensation, response and in the embodiment as a whole.

Title: SensiMAR - Designing a Multisensory AR System

Abstract: To deliver more intense and enhanced experiences, multisensory applications have the goal to stimulate all our senses. The way these multisensory systems have been implemented is very distinct, since there are a lot of different approaches among them, aiming different goals. Thus, the structure defined for these systems depends on the stimuli that are being exploited, the technologies that are being used, the context in which they are being implemented, and on what is intended to obtain with the system. This study aims to propose the design of a multisensory system, named SensiMAR, that will provide an outdoor multisensory AR experience located at a cultural heritage site, allowing users to perceive different levels of immersion with the addition of a spatialized soundscape and with related smells.

Title: Developing Training Applications for Hydrogen Emergency Response Training

Abstract: Virtual Reality (VR) has been evolving over the years, becoming more and more accessible, in a wide area of applications. One of these areas where VR can have a major impact is training and certification. Hydrogen vehicles are becoming a reality and first responders still lack proper tools and resources to train emergency responses for the purpose. VR can play here a crucial role in ensuring a proper hydrogen emergency response training due to the advantages associated with VR training programs such as resource optimization, repeatability, and replicability. This paper proposes using VR for hydrogen emergency response training by developing a solution composed of three components: tutorial mode, training mode, and certification mode. A usability study is further conducted to evaluate its usability and user satisfaction. The results show that the use of this application regards usability and user satisfaction were extremely positive.

Title: Involving communities in shaping digital solutions for innovation in societies and territories

Abstract: The role and potential of digital tools, in supporting citizens and communities who are leading territory-based innovation, is not yet entirely understood. To contribute to addressing this gap, this research conducted two focus groups with two sets of five community-let initiatives. Following a mixed-coding approach, data was analysed to identify the mediation and communication tools that communities use, as well as the purposes of use, and the experiences prompted by the use of those tools. Data was also analysed to develop an understanding of the attributes and features desired in a future digital solution, that could best support communities' activities. Results show that both, small- and larger-sized initiatives, avail of a breath of digital tools to develop their activities, in a scenario where traditional tools continue to hold an important role. Yet, while small-sized initiatives strive to promote their activities and to develop synergies with local peers, larger-sized initiates are more concerned with optimizing digital media use and with continuing to engage in face-to-face interactions, with the multiple agents they work with.

Title: A Generator of User Interface Prototypes for the IVY Workbench

Abstract: The IVY Workbench is a tool that supports the modeling and formal verification of interactive systems. The tool features a set of plugins that support the modeling and analysis process, including a models editor, a properties checker, and a models animator. The latter, allows visualizing and interacting with a model, but does not support associating it with a prototype of the system. Interaction with the model facilitates its validation by modelling experts. It does not, however, facilitate communication with domain experts and users, to whom a prototype would be a more effective means of communication. This article presents the work done to remedy this gap in IVY. The article details the preliminary research carried out, architectural decisions and the obtained end result.

Title: Evaluation of Antialiasing Techniques on Mobile Devices

Abstract: In the last years, the adoption of mobile devices such as smartphones has been massive. Mobile devices are used to play video-games as well as to simulate virtual worlds in virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality experiences. In the field of real-time rendering, antialiasing is still an open problem, with recent advances focusing on post-processing and temporal solutions. Particularly, for mobile environments, research on this topic is scarce. This work analyses a set of antialiasing techniques commonly used on desktop applications and their suitability for mobile devices. An Android application was developed to test four antialiasing techniques and the results were evaluated in terms of computational performance and visual quality. The results show that while multisampling antialiasing (MSAA) and fast-approximate antialiasing (FXAA) provide the fastest execution and subpixel morphological antialiasing (SMAA) draws images of superior quality, the optimal balance is obtained with MSAA. Performance figures are similar to desktop implementations, with the exception of MSAA which performs better due to the tiled-based rendering architecture present on mobile GPUs.

Title: Knowledge Analysis Automatic Evaluation in Virtual Reality Immersive Experiences

Abstract: Museums and exhibitions usually attempt to evaluate visitors' obtained knowledge through the use of traditional evaluation methods such as questionnaires. These are intrusive and may not provide correct results, especially due to the fact that visitors are usually not interested in being evaluated and may consider such questionnaires as intelligence tests. This paper proposes methods of design and creation of automatic evaluation techniques that make use of Virtual Reality (VR) in order to evaluate users' obtained knowledge after playing through a VR museum game experience. This Analysis System is non-intrusive (its methodology does not impact users' immersion and engagement), valid (can draw conclusions regarding users' obtained knowledge), and replicable (designed techniques can be used in a variety of experiences). Results indicate that the designed assessment techniques can be used to automatically evaluate the knowledge obtained by users throughout the experience, as well as some considerations to keep in mind when designing game experiences with these techniques.
