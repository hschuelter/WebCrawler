Title: La vitesse de défilement des barres de progression influence-t-elle la perception du temps d'attente?

Abstract: This research focuses on the satisfaction and waiting times perceived by a user during the moments where the interaction between the user and the system is temporarily interrupted (file download, setup of a program, etc.). These waiting times are often sources of anxiety and irritation. They go usually with the presentation of an animated progress bar. The objective of this research is to study the impact of different variable-rate progress bars by varying the speed of scrolling. Thus, we are interested in the effects of acceleration and deceleration between progress bars positions. The results confirm the existence of a causal link between perception of waiting time and satisfaction. In addition, a progress bar with a decelerating speed is significantly more appreciated by the users. The results may provide valuable information for the design of computer interfaces.

Title: Using the user's point of view for interaction on mobile devices

Abstract: We study interaction modalities for mobile devices (smartphones and tablets) that rely on a camera-based head tracking. This technique defines new possibilities for input and output interaction. For output, by computing the position of the device according to the user's head, it is for example possible to realistically control the viewpoint on a 3D scene (Head-Coupled Perspective, HCP). This technique improves the output interaction bandwidth by enhancing the depth perception and by allowing the visualization of large workspaces (virtual window). For input, head movement can be used as a means of interacting with a mobile device. Moreover such an input modality does not require any additional sensor except the built-in front-facing camera. In this paper, we classify the interaction possibilities offered by head tracking on smartphones and tablets. We then focus on the output interaction by introducing several applications of HCP on both smartphones and tablets and by presenting the results of a qualitative user experiment.

Title: From gaze plots to eye fixation patterns using a clustering method based on Hausdorff distances

Abstract: Eye-tracking studies have provided us with interesting findings regarding the way users explore Web pages. Usually, visual fixations are represented using gaze plots and heatmaps. Probably one of the most cited studies on Web page exploration is the one by Nielsen [15] who demonstrated that users often read Web pages in an F-shaped pattern. However, this conclusion is based on aggregated data that do not represent any real user. In order to characterize and to compare scanpaths so as to uncover possible scan-patterns, a clustering method based on the Hausdorff distance has been applied to the data from 113 users. The results have shown that scan-patterns could be identified. Groups of users have been identified and their behaviors have been described with diverse eye-tracking metrics. The contributions of this study are outlined as well as its drawbacks. Research perspectives are proposed.

Title: SAM: the Swiss Army Menu

Abstract: This article introduces the Swiss Army Menu (SAM), a radial menu that enables a very large number of functions on a single small tactile screen. The design of SAM relies on four different kinds of items, support for navigating in hierarchies of items and a control based on small thumb movements. SAM can thus offer a set of functions so large that it would typically have required a number of widgets that could not have been displayed in a single viewport at the same time.

Title: TouchOver: decoupling positioning from selection on touch-based handheld devices

Abstract: When compared to conventional desktop mouse input, touch input on handheld devices suffers from the lack of a main feature: that of a mouseover state that can provide users with dynamic pro-active information. In addition, with touch screens, selection precision is limited by undesired extra finger tracking during finger press and lift movements.We propose TouchOver, a multi-modal input technique for touch-screen accelerometers-enabled handheld devices where positioning is performed with a finger on the touch surface, while selection is triggered by a gentle "tilt forward" of the device. By doing so, TouchOver adds a mouseover-like state and improves selection precision while remaining compatible with existing interaction techniques such as Shift [10] devised to improve precision. Our formal user study shows a significant precision improvement over two other selection techniques as well as a good tradeoff between speed and accuracy.

Title: Analyse de la tâche de diagnostic et évaluation d'IHM en imagerie médicale

Abstract: Biomedical imaging has become an essential part of patient care. The emergence of new technologies raises important questions concerning the most appropriate display station, the most appropriate image optimisation technique and the level of experience the reader brings to the assessment process. The Equimose project considers these issues and applies a global approach to the diagnostic reading process in MRI and nuclear medicine.Human-Computer Interaction is an essential part of the present study, whereby all tools used in the diagnostic process are considered and analysed e.g. peripheral I/O and software. All software tools, which are manipulated by the reader, are considered with the ultimate aim of defining a global task model that includes and represents the specificities of a selection of reading tasks as represented by MRI and PET imaging modalities.

Title: "Draw me the Web": impact of mental model of the web on information search performance of young users

Abstract: The aim of this experiment conducted with 51 French children was to understand the relationships between children's information search performances and their mental model of the Web. Each participant was individually asked (a) to complete a demographic questionnaire asking experience with the Web, (b) to draw a picture of her/his perception about the Web, and (c) to perform two search tasks. The results showed that several mental models existed for young users about the Web, independently of their experience with the Web. Moreover, the results confirmed that mental model of the Web could have an effect on the performance.

Title: Amélioration du circuit visuel des contrôleurs aériens pour relier les données entre visualisations en utilisant des transitions animées

Abstract: Several separate displays are used by Air Traffic Controllers, such as radar view, flight lists view or paper strips. In order to link the information between these views and keep focus on a subset of flights, controllers are required to do visual operations (eye gaze, analysis of visual properties etc.). This process can be disruptive when traffic increases and when visualizations display large amounts of objects. In this paper we propose the use of animated transitions to replace the visual paths controllers take. We discuss this technique and show results of a predictive evaluation that suggests an improvement in users' performance.

Title: Forecasting tool on a mobile device

Abstract: Within the domain of predictive analytics [7, 11], this paper presents a mobile application for data forecasting [9] and its corresponding user interface. Although forecasting tools already exist, none of them were available on mobile devices. With a focus on simplicity, we present the results of usability surveys, based on interactions assumptions we took. These interactions use current mobile best practices, mainly leveraging touch screens and multi-touch capacities. We also present performance results, and their impact and users perception. This paper illustrates this work through a use case on budget forecasting for a city mayor.

Title: Visualisation de digests d'emails en entreprise

Abstract: In this article we focus on emails digests visualization, namely the graphical representation of a compact set of emails in a single email [26]. The objective of this technique is to synthesize a set of data contained in emails to assist the user in decision-making and results sharing. Our contribution consists in extending the techniques introduced in [26] by describing digests examples, using visualization techniques such as word clouds or graphs. We detail the implementation as a webmail and we discuss our early technical and ergonomic issues observed while deploying this technique in a production context.

Title: Utilisation d'outils de visual data mining pour l'exploration d'un ensemble de règles d'association

Abstract: Data Mining aims at extracting maximum of knowledge from huge databases. It is realized by an automatic process or by data visual exploration with interactive tools. Automatic data mining extracts all the patterns which match a set of metrics. The limit of such algorithms is the amount of extracted data which can be larger than the initial data volume. In this article, we focus on association rules extraction with Apriori algorithm. After the description of a characterization model of a set of association rules, we propose to explore the results of a Data Mining algorithm with an interactive visual tool. There are two advantages. First it will visualize the results of the algorithms from different points of view (metrics, rules attributes...). Then it allows us to select easily inside large set of rules the most relevant ones.

Title: Promesses et contraintes de la joaillerie numérique interactive: un aperçu de l'état de l'art

Abstract: The miniaturization of electronic components paves the way for new interaction techniques for wearable computing. We briefly review interactive digital jewelry, an emerging subfield. We report the data of a limited poll about the way people perceive the prospect of digital jewelry. We then consider the constraints and the promise of digital jewelry, and finally classify the current solutions, which generally resort to gestural interaction.

Title: Etude exploratoire du stylo électronique pour le Contrôle Aérien

Abstract: Current environment used by air traffic controllers mixes digital visualizations (radar screen), and tangible systems with paper strip. Despite the fact that paper strip are robust, flexible and complementary to the radar screen, authorities decided to abandon it in the profit of digital strip. The main issue of paper strip is that the system does not have access to the information written on it. In this paper, we studied an alternative solution with hybrids Anoto pens with contiuous streaming. We first retrieved important tasks performed by air traffic controller, second, we investigated to find out efficient interaction paradigm for their activity. Finally, we developed and assessed an operational prototype with new functionalities. This suggests that it is possible to retain advantages of existing paper strip while informing informatics systems and improving interaction.

Title: Analyse procédurale: un nouveau paradigme pour l'analyse de tracés manuscrits

Abstract: In this paper, we present a new axis concerning a possible use of pen based HCI. It is common to use those interfaces for applications concerning visuo-spatial treatments such as shape recognition. But we believe that the possibilities offered by those interface allow one to consider other kind of treatments focusing not on the shape but on analyzing drawer's process during the sketching activity. Those approaches, that we call ≪ Procedural analysis >, are almost nonexistent. In this article we will detail what is a procedural analysis and we will show some possible uses of those kinds of methods.

Title: Un espace de caractérisation de la télécommande dans le contexte de la télévision interactive

Abstract: Initially designed in the nineteen seventies as a mere zapping tool, obviously the traditional device known as the TV remote control no longer responds to the multifarious needs of today's interactive television. Designing new remote-control devices is a challenge that the HCI community has started to face. The paper indicates the various directions that are currently being investigated by researchers. The paper starts with an attempt to characterize the specific context of interactive TV. We then offer a tentative account of the design and evaluation space of interest. There is little doubt that the traditional remote control may still be improved and augmented. It is unlikely, however, that it will survive for long the crisis it has been undergoing since the beginning of the digital era, given the emerging plethora of alternative interaction possibilities based on a variety of new interfacing logics, which the paper reviews.

Title: SPEED: prédiction de cibles

Abstract: We present the SPEED method to predict endpoints, based on analysis of the kinetic characteristics of the pointing gesture. Our model splits the gesture into an acceleration phase and a deceleration phase to precisely detect target. The first phase allows us to identify a velocity peak that marks the beginning of the second phase. This phase is approached with a quadratic model to predict gesture endpoint. A pilot study shows that SPEED predicts a target more precisely than other existing methods, for 1D tasks without distractors.

Title: Extension de la norme ISO 9241-9 au pointage en 3D

Abstract: Nowadays, more applications use the visualization of three-dimensional data to represent complex data. But interaction tasks for this kind of environment do not take benefits from formal evaluation methods. We propose to extend the 9241-9 ISO standard, which gives recommendations for pointing task in 1D or 2D, to a 3D pointing task. We describe our protocol used to evaluate the performance and the satisfaction of users.

Title: Edition synchrone de plusieurs objets: services et interaction

Abstract: Graphical interactions that modify many objects at once have not been studied systematically. Based on contextual inquiries of designers, and on previous systems and work, we have identified the services required for an efficient interaction with multiple objects: set management, action management, and support for exploratory design. We present a number of interactions that provide a subset of the identified services, by relying on an improved property sheet. This work may enable designers to design more consistent and more powerful interactions.

Title: Inspirer, explorer: Magellan, un environnement interactif evolutionnaire pour la génération d'exemples

Abstract: Creativity is key in User Interfaces (UI) design. Numerous methods and tools exist for supporting creativity. However few have focused on the presentation of examples so far. We propose Magellan an interactive evolutionary environment to semi-automatically generate examples galleries suited to the problem under study. We report a qualitative evaluation of Magellan for designing an Instant Messenger UI.

Title: Prototypage basé sur les modèles de tâches: une étude pilote

Abstract: Task models, which have been designed for activity modeling, are used in different ways, for interactive system evaluation or design. In this work, we present a pilot study on task-based prototyping. We show how leaning on task models may make collaborative work easier between business experts and software designers, for identifying precise required functionalities.

Title: Composing applications with OntoCompo

Abstract: In this paper, we present an ontology-based approach to compose applications while preserving their former look. Our composition process relies on the manipulation of User Interfaces (UI) and on several ontologies describing relationships between tasks, UI and Functionalities. Our tool, called OntoCompo, supports compositions realized by the developer thanks to the selection, extraction and positioning of UI elements to constitute the new application.

Title: La place de l'ergonomie dans un projet de conception d'une R&D industrielle, le cas du tri des déchets télé-opéré

Abstract: Over the 4 years of designing of this distance waste-sorting machine, ergonomics has been considered more and more influential. The activity analysis in particular has raised a number of questions on the tool functionalities and its place in the work management, questions which proved to be crucial in the aspect of production performance. Therefore greater efforts have been made to create initially unplanned user tests at different stages of the project designing.Today, the man-machine interaction is most important. Especially in the tools adaptation to new waste-fields, which recognition can be more or less difficult for an operator.

Title: Designing affective animations with children as design partners using role-playing

Abstract: This paper describes a user-centred participatory-design method, novel to the domain of interaction design of affective components for learning, for gathering user requirements from children. The method was considered to be suitable and appealing for children in terms of participating in design, and led to the definition of a sample of digital animations that portray a set of emotional states. The method's main novelty lies in the use of real actors as design partners to express affect, and includes comic strips in the data gathered. This method is believed of value for future design of affective components in educational context by, and for, children.

Title: Feeding the digital parrot: capturing situational context in an augmented memory system

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the capturing of information for augmented memory systems. We focus on user-selected capturing of trigger data to remember events in people's lives. We propose the method of marking moments and report the results of a five-stage user study that explored our method. We studied how to best support the capturing activity, which data to capture and in which way. We observed how each of our 30 participants recorded data for later use while visiting the local zoo.

Title: Smart-phone augmented reality for public participation in urban planning

Abstract: We investigate smart-phone based augmented reality architecture as a tool for aiding public participation in urban planning. A smart-phone prototype system was developed which showed 3D virtual representations of proposed architectural designs visualised on top of existing real-world architecture, with an appropriate interface to accommodate user actions and basic feedback. Members of the public participated in a user study where they used the prototype system as part of a simulated urban planning event. The prototype system demonstrated a new application of augmented reality architecture and an accessible way for members of the public to participate in urban planning projects.

Title: A quantitative quality model for gesture based user interfaces

Abstract: The technological advancement of computers and cameras over the past few years has given us the ability to control objects without touching them. There have already been a number of attempts at producing gesture based applications, but many of them have usability issues. This paper proposes a model that reflects the usability of a gesture based interface, in order to evaluate and improve a gesture-controlled system. The model defines four levels of abstraction, with the higher levels based on the lower ones. The levels of the model allow us to propose quantitative notions for 1) the parameters affecting the quality of individual gestures, 2) the overall quality of a gesture, 3) the quality of particular functionalities, or use cases, in a system, and 4) the overall quality of a system. The model was evaluated using an existing gesture-based interface for a popular media center application.

Title: Extending mobile user ambient awareness for nomadic text entry

Abstract: Nowadays, we input text not only on stationary devices, but also on handheld devices while walking, driving, or commuting. Text entry on the move, which we term as nomadic text entry, is generally slower. This is partially due to the need for users to move their visual focus from the device to their surroundings for navigational purposes and back. To investigate if better feedback about users' surroundings on the device can improve performance, we present a number of new and existing feedback systems: textual, visual, textual & visual, and textual & visual via translucent keyboard. Experimental comparisons between the conventional and these techniques established that increased ambient awareness for mobile users enhances nomadic text entry performance. Results showed that the textual and the textual & visual via translucent keyboard conditions increased text entry speed by 14% and 11%, respectively, and reduced the error rate by 13% compared to the regular technique. The two methods also significantly reduced the number of collisions with obstacles.

Title: Theoretical foundations for user-controlled forgetting in scrutable long term user models

Abstract: Emerging technologies are making it feasible for people to capture large amounts of personal information that can support important aspects of their lives. When that information is stored in a persistent storage so that it can drive personalisation, it is called a user model. There has been little exploration of systematic approaches to enable people to gain control over such user models using forgetting mechanisms. This paper first presents reasons why such forgetting mechanisms are desirable. Then it analyses core forms of human forgetting as the basis for a theoretical model of forgetting in user models. Our key contribution is to establish theoretical foundations for the design of mechanisms and interfaces for forgetting in stores of personal information, with the goal of user control of these mechanisms, so that we can enable people to achieve a new form of control over their personal information and its use.

Title: Using mobile device screens for authentication

Abstract: Authentication in public spaces, such as ATM PIN entry, is inherently susceptible to security attacks based on observation in person or via cameras. This paper addresses this problem with a system which allows users to enter a PIN on a standard mobile phone and then transmit it securely for authentication using modulated patterns of light shown on the screen and sensed by a cheap bespoke receiver unit. No pre-pairing is required as physical proximity guarantees security. The paper presents several hardware and software variations, evaluates the technical soundness of the system, and presents two user studies addressing usability and security against observation attacks.

Title: Discovery table exploring the design of tangible and ubiquitous technology for learning in preparatory classrooms

Abstract: In this paper we investigate how technologies can be designed to support learning in preparatory classrooms by augmenting existing learning objects. By following an iterative interaction design process of working with teachers and children within the classroom environment, we can better design technologies through the augmentation (rather than replacement) of existing learning activities. Our case study -- the Discovery Table -- uses a variety of technologies to allow everyday plastic symbols of letters and numbers to be placed on a technology augmented table in order to provide visual, audible and tangible feedback to the children. Discovery Table demonstrates a first step towards more fundamental work towards successful design for tangible learning.

Title: Interactive kaleidoscope: audience participation study

Abstract: This paper presents a physical user interface design approach based on interactive art pieces. A range of interactive video installations have been developed by the first author and presented at festivals and exhibitions, enabling audiences to co-create images of kaleidoscopic patterns and textures through movement and tangible interaction. The focus of this paper is the reporting of a semi-structured study in a museum context, addressing the three research questions of whether people are drawn into the installation, whether the interaction is clear, and to what extent the participants become engaged. The findings reveal that audiences are attracted and that the levels of engagement are satisfactory in the context of children exploring the museum. We propose five stages of interaction reflecting the engagement.

Title: Rewriting history: more power to creative people

Abstract: Trying out different alternatives is a natural part of creative work, resulting in several versions that are hard to manage. With the tools available today, we often end up having to manually redo changes that worked in one version on other versions. We propose a new approach for supporting creative work: an artifact is described as the history of the operations that created it. We show that by allowing users to change this history, the common use cases of merging, generalizing and specializing can be supported efficiently. This rewriting history approach is based on a formal specification of the operations offered by a tool, leads to a new theory of operations, and enables exciting new ways to share and combine creative work. It is complementary to state-based version control, and offers the user a new understanding of merging. The approach was implemented for a collaborative drawing tool, and evaluated in a user study. The study shows that users understand the approach and would like to use it in their own creative work.

Title: Designing games to educate diabetic children

Abstract: The use of computer games as common vehicles for education, as opposed to pure entertainment, has gained popularity in recent years. Traditional method for diabetes education relies heavily on written materials and there is only a limited amount of resources targeted at educating diabetic children. In this paper, we present a novel approach for designing computer games aimed for educating children with diabetes. Our game design was applied to an existing open source game (Mario Brothers). The results of a pilot study showed that participants enjoyed playing the game and found it valuable for educating diabetic patients.

Title: A comparison of four methods for cognitive load measurement

Abstract: Recognizing users' cognitive load during tasks is among the most important considerations for adaptive automation and interface evaluation. This paper compares four methods of measuring user cognitive load, that is, subjective rating of task difficulty, task completion time, performance accuracy and eye activity based physiological measurement. In order to be practically useful, the measurement should be sensitive to task difficulty variation and accurately predict user cognitive load. In this study, we examined the sensitivity and accuracy of these measures for five levels of cognitive load. ANOVA tests and Gaussian mixture model classification results show that subjective rating of task difficulty is the most effective measure, meanwhile eye activity based measure is as sensitive and accurate as using task completion time to classify two or more cognitive load levels, but has the relative advantage of being a real time measure and not requiring a specific action.

Title: Presenting search results of meeting documents

Abstract: Information plays an important role in organisations, allowing management to make sound decisions. Many organisations keep documents in electronic format, and as the number and volume of documents increases, search and retrieval become tedious and difficult. Effective presentation of search results is an important user interface issue for any search tool in this context. Search results can be composed of a number of different elements, including file details, text extracts and thumbnail images.This study considered the effectiveness of several search result presentation elements in the context of a desktop search tool used to search for relevant meeting minute documents. Participants were presented with search results from two existing desktop search applications and one test application developed by the authors. The participants were then asked to evaluate the quality of different elements of the result presentation. Responses indicated that domain-specific presentation elements are valuable to users, allowing them to effectively determine the relevance of individual search result items. The results also suggest that other domain specific search tools would benefit from customised search result presentation.

Title: Seamless interaction in space

Abstract: As more electronic devices enter the living room, there is a need to explore new ways to provide seamless interaction with them over a range of different distances. In this paper we describe a proximity-based interface that allows users to interact with screen content both within arm's length and at a distance. To support such a wide interaction range we combine speech and gesture input with a secondary display, and have the interface change dynamically depending on the user proximity. We conducted a user evaluation of our prototype system and found that users were impressed with the away from screen interfaces, and believed that changing the interface based on proximity would be useful for larger displays. We present the lessons learned and discuss directions for future research.

Title: Learning a physical skill via a computer: a case study exploring Australian Sign Language

Abstract: The aim of this research project was to consider the implications of teaching a physical skill using a computer. The case study that was used was the development of a resource for teaching Australian Sign Language (Auslan) to hearing people that could be customised to cater for user's individual learning preferences. Learning Auslan as visual spatial languages presents several interesting human--computer interaction challenges to the interface designer as the user is trying to learn a physical skill via the computer. In addition, multiple vocabularies could be targeted to meet the needs of different users by implementing dynamic insertion of resources. The premise for this approach was to empower the deaf community to create and customise their own teaching resources rather than being dependent on a programmer for each new version of the learning material.

Title: Online assessment: splitting the screen to be seen

Abstract: The limited viewing space provided by online assessment tools makes it difficult for a student to view supportive graphics, scripts or diagrams where the viewing screen is smaller than the complete question. This paper reports on the user centred design and the application of a bifocal information visualisation technique for the display of graphics of an online multiple choice assessment tool. Traditional online tests require the students to scroll down the viewing page to study a question's supporting graphic or diagram and then scroll up again to insert their response. In many instances, this drastically increased the level of tension in a student, who would lose sight of the graphic when answering the question. Consequently, the increased cognitive load often resulted in errors. We provide a presentation technique that displays the question in readable text with a compressed, distorted vision of the supportive graphic/diagram. This enables students to focus on the graphic when considering their answer while not losing sight of the question itself. Furthermore, it allows the student to toggle freely between a focus on the graphic and the question. Our evaluation of this bifocal display demonstrates a notable decrease in errors being made during transcription of answers, and a decrease in the stress level for students during the test.

Title: Beyond interaction: meta-design and cultures of participation

Abstract: Most interesting, important, and pressing problems facing societies in the 21st century transcend the unaided individual human mind. They require collaborative systems to explore, frame, solve, and assess their solutions. Cultures of participation represent foundations for the next generation of collaborative systems by supporting all stakeholders to participate actively in personally meaningful problems. Meta-design supports cultures of participation by defining and creating social and technical infrastructures in which users can choose to become designers. These developments create new discourses in human-computer interaction (HCI), complementing and transcending current approaches centered on interaction.This article illustrates these objectives and themes with specific examples and articulates their relevance for the OzCHI conference theme "Design, Culture and Interaction".

Title: Courtroom evidence presentation technology: overcoming traditional barriers

Abstract: The Supreme Court of Victoria is an heritage listed building steeped in tradition and reticent to physical change. The current capability of the courtrooms to exhibit advanced technology derived evidence is substantially inadequate. This paper discusses the negative environmental impact, the inadequacies of courtroom facilities and inconsistencies in comparison to the available evidence and the requirements of jurors and courts in relation to evidence presentation. It also discusses the issues, possibilities and limitations involved in the implementation of an IT solution to the presentation of evidence.

Title: Orientation Passport: using gamification to engage university students

Abstract: Adding game elements to an application to motivate use and enhance the user experience is a growing trend known as gamification. This study explores the use of game achievements when applied to a mobile application designed to help new students at university. This paper describes the foundations of a design framework used to integrate game elements to Orientation Passport, a personalised orientation event application for smart phones. Orientation Passport utilises game achievements to present orientation information in an engaging way and to encourage use of the application. The system is explained in terms of the design framework, and the findings of a pilot study involving 26 new students are presented. This study contributes the foundations of a design framework for general gamified achievement design. It also suggests that added game elements can be enjoyable but can potentially encourage undesirable use by some, and aren't as enjoyable if not enforced properly by the technology. Consideration is also needed when enforcing stricter game rules as usability can be affected.

Title: Fixing the city one photo at a time: mobile logging of maintenance requests

Abstract: We have designed a mobile application that takes advantage of the built-in features of smart phones such as camera and GPS that allow users to take geo-tagged photos while on the move. Urban residents can take pictures of broken street furniture and public property requiring repair, attach a brief description, and submit the information as a maintenance request to the local government organisation of their city. This paper discusses the design approach that led to the application, highlights a built-in mechanism to elicit user feedback, and evaluates the progress to date with user feedback and log statistics. It concludes with an outlook highlighting user requested features and our own design aspirations for moving from a reporting tool to a civic engagement tool.

Title: Widgets to support disabled learners: a challenge to participatory inclusive design

Abstract: This paper describes a combinatorial methodology that responds to the challenge of inclusive design drawing from the fields of participatory design and agile development. We describe the Widgets for Inclusive Distributed Environment (WIDE) study that aims to produce open source widgets that can be plugged into a range of learning environments to support disabled learners and are freely available for use and adaptation by the wider community. The research adopted a mixed methodology by involving disabled learners not just as research subjects but as consultants, designers and partners. We describe the WIDE process in terms of the participants' involvement. The evaluation findings of the study highlight the importance of a mixed methodology for inclusive e-learning design and contribute to the understanding of HCI approaches in the context of designing participatory studies.

Title: Using sticky light technology for projected guidance

Abstract: A worker performing a physical task may need to ask for advice and guidance from an expert. This can be a problem if the expert is in some distant location. We describe a system which allows the expert to see the workplace from the worker's point of view, and to draw annotations directly into that workplace using a picoprojector. Since the system can be worn by the worker, these projected annotations may move with the worker's movements. We describe two methods of sticking these annotations to the original positions thereby compensating for the movement of the worker.

Title: Identifying stakeholder perspectives in a large collaborative project: an ICT4D case study

Abstract: This paper explores some of the benefits of formally capturing stakeholder perspectives through conducting stakeholder interviews in a large, collaborative project. The case study discussed is an Information and Communication Technologies for Development (ICT4D) venture between two universities, industry, government and communities based in the former homeland of Transkei in rural South Africa. Benefits of conducting stakeholder interviews are discussed through the early analysis of two areas: stakeholder agendas and success criteria identified by stakeholders. The stakeholder interviews highlight the variety and range of agendas in projects involving multiple organisations, as well as the need and respective challenges of capturing community perspectives in this project. It also provides support for the need to conduct evaluations, as well as guidance for what the evaluation should include.

Title: Same system---different experiences: physicians' and nurses' experiences in using IT systems

Abstract: In this paper we use a sociotechnical approach and theories about group processes to analyse how two main clinician groups, nurses and physicians, are influenced by their main IT tool, the Electronic Patient Record (EPR), in their clinical practice. The paper is based on interviews with 19 physicians and 17 nurses that work at a Swedish university hospital. The clinicians considered the use of an EPR system necessary, but experienced the need to change their clinical practice to less efficient work routines in order for the EPR system to support them. The main result of the paper is that the EPR system affected nurses and physicians differently. The physicians were more frustrated and experienced that the EPR system worsened their clinical practice and a decreased status among the other clinical professions. The nurses on the other hand experienced that their work became more visible than before and found it easier to claim the importance of their work towards the physicians.

Title: Elastic experiences: designing adaptive interaction for individuals and crowds in the public space

Abstract: This paper presents insights into the design process acquired during the implementation and evaluation of an interactive art installation for two very distinct public environments. Issues of scalability, robustness and performance became progressively interwoven with the concern of creating an overall user experience sustaining consistent high engagement levels. Contextual factors such as audience size, dimensions of the interactive space and length of exposure to the artwork had to be handled gracefully in order not to interfere with the interaction flow. Adopting a research by and through design approach, the work uncovered a series of findings that are pervasive to the design of adaptive interactive experiences.

Title: Investigating interactive search behaviour of medical students: an exploratory survey

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate medical students medical search behavior on a medical domain. We use two behavioral signals: detailed query analysis (qualitative and quantitative) and task completion time to understand how medical students perform medical searches based on varying task complexity. We also investigate how task complexity and topic familiarity affect search behavior. We gathered 80 interactive search sessions from an exploratory survey with 20 medical students. We observe information searching behavior using 3 simulated work task scenarios and 1 personal scenario. We present quantitative results from two perspectives: overall and user perceived task complexity. We also analyze query properties from a qualitative aspect. Our results show task complexity and topic familiarity affect search behavior of medical students. In some cases, medical students demonstrate different search traits on a personal task in comparison to the simulated work task scenarios. These findings help us better understand medical search behavior. Medical search engines can use these findings to detect and adapt to medical students' search behavior to enhance a student's search experience.

Title: Mobile internet, internet on mobiles or just internet you access with variety of devices?

Abstract: The role of Internet on mobile phones has changed in just few years. Touch screen devices allow improved browsing experience and WLAN and high speed networks enable good connectivity. As people have free of charge WLAN or flat fee agreement with their cellular provider, they either pay nothing for connectivity or same money, no matter how much they browse. The cost and quality of the connectivity have earlier been bottlenecks of mobile Internet. Improvements in these have enabled the change in usage patterns of mobiles, which has influenced also in how computers are used.

Title: Visualising web browsing data for user behaviour analysis

Abstract: The rapid growth of Internet usage has dramatically changed the way we interact with the outside world. Many people read news, communicate with friends and purchase goods online. These activities are usually done via web browsing. Understanding user web browsing behaviour is important in improving their browsing experience. For example, website usability and the personalization of online services could both benefit from knowledge of user browsing patterns. Much research has been done on understanding user web browsing behaviour. However, the usefulness of visualisations has not been fully explored in this space. In this paper, we introduce a system that offers three different ways of visualising web browsing data. This system provides a common interface for users to interact with the visualisations. We also present an evaluation of the system with end users. We show that by visualising a user's web browsing history, we are able to uncover interesting patterns in the way that individuals use the Web.

Title: Playing the game: effective gender role analysis techniques for computer games

Abstract: The majority of gender studies of computer games examines game subsets, such as the first twenty minutes of gameplay, and extends their conclusions to the whole game and the game industry in general. The hypothesis of the subset effectively representing the entire game requires testing. This study addresses this problem by comparing the results of two commonly used subset methods to an analysis of a whole game.The findings show that the two subset analyses fail to identify gender representation inequalities that examining a whole game was able to discover. This result throws into doubt subset analysis methodology in games and indicates that the results of current subset techniques, such as those used by government games rating boards, are flawed. In analyzing the whole game, this study has developed a gender role coding technique for whole games that may be useful in future studies.

Title: A toolkit for designing interactive musical agents

Abstract: We have developed a prototype software toolkit to enable non-technical users to design artificially intelligent agents to perform electronic music in collaboration with a human musician. In this paper we describe the toolkit and present a preliminary investigation of its use. We then discuss how the investigation has helped identify issues to address in an upcoming user-centred design study, which will take place in Spring 2011.

Title: What we have here is a failure of companionship: communication in goal-oriented team-mate games

Abstract: There is a fairly common assumption about real-time, goal oriented, multiplayer games: communication is primarily appreciated (and used) for more effectively attaining goals. But an interesting question that does not seem to have been explored in the literature is whether the desire for companionship is a significant factor in people's desire for and use of communication channels in real-time, goal-oriented, cooperative games. A qualitative study was conducted in which 40 participants played variations of a real-time, goal-oriented, cooperative game with either human or artificial (AI) team-mates, using different communication modalities. Participants consistently expressed a strong desire for the ability to communicate with a team-mate, arguing that it made gameplay more effective and more enjoyable. The significant finding of this study is that in some cases, the strong desire for (and use of) communication channels in realtime, goal-oriented, cooperative games seems to actually be more of a desire for (and experience of) social companionship.

Title: A jump to the left (and then a step to the right): reading practices within academic ebooks

Abstract: Considerable attention has been paid to how readers find, triage, navigate and read periodical material such as journal articles. Until recently however, applying these questions to books has been impractical or impossible. This paper reports an exploratory log analysis of ebook usage in an academic library. This study investigates raw usage, document triage practices, and in-book navigation.

Title: Designing navigation and wayfinding in 3D virtual learning spaces

Abstract: As the use of virtual worlds in education continues to grow, it is important that designers and educators consider the interaction design and usability of three-dimensional (3D) virtual learning spaces as being integral to student learning and engagement. In a previous project on the design of learning spaces in virtual worlds, we uncovered that difficulties with navigation and wayfinding are the key usability problems that impact on the student experience. Second Life is the most commonly used virtual world for educational purposes. Based upon empirical investigations in Second Life, we have derived heuristics and guidelines for the design of 3D virtual learning spaces to facilitate navigation and wayfinding. Qualitative data arising from heuristic evaluations and user observations enabled a variety of navigational aids to be assessed for their suitability in designs of 3D virtual learning spaces. We have also derived best practice examples for navigational aids such as maps, signs, paths and landmarks.

Title: Bridging the representation and interaction challenges of mobile context-aware computing: designing agile ridesharing

Abstract: The increasing capability of mobile devices and social networks to gather contextual and social data has led to increased interest in context-aware computing for mobile applications. This paper explores ways of reconciling two different viewpoints of context, representational and interactional, that have arisen respectively from technical and social science perspectives on context-aware computing. Through a case study in agile ridesharing, the importance of dynamic context control, historical context and broader context is discussed. We build upon earlier work that has sought to address the divide by further explicating the problem in the mobile context and expanding on the design approaches.

Title: Pseudo-direct touch: interaction for collaboration in large and high-resolution displays environments

Abstract: In this paper, we present an exploration of an interaction technique designed for large and high-resolution display environments in collaborative work situations. We introduce the Pseudo-Direct Touch technique to enable users to interact with a large display from a distance through a transparent touch frame. The touch points on the frame are projected onto the distant large display, so that users have the impression of touching on the large display directly. This approach combines the advantages of intuitive interface for individuals and interaction design that supports unobstructed awareness and face-to-face contact for collaborations in display environments. We assessed our design and performance of our technique in a user study, and gauge the effect of parallax on accuracy during absolute selections. Finally, we trialled a prototypical user application and observed fluent interactions by most participants.

Title: Natural interactions between augmented virtual objects

Abstract: There are many situations in which physical interaction with real-world objects is not possible -- for example, museums contain many objects or artefacts which are too fragile or expensive for the public to handle. Augmented Reality (AR) has the potential to offer an alternative in these situations, but most of our current interactions with virtual objects in AR tend to be indirect. Tangible AR allows for natural movement, but we rarely manipulate or control virtual objects beyond that in the way we do their physical counterparts. To address this problem, we propose that a more natural approach to interacting with tangible AR be introduced. We present a prototype that allows users to physically orientate virtual objects so that they 'snap' together in order to complete a '3D AR Puzzle', and show that introducing 'responsive virtual objects' for tangible AR is a promising first step towards more natural interactions.

Title: Using mobile phones for promoting water conservation

Abstract: We report a design investigation that seeks to help people to conserve water in their homes through the use of mobile technology. To persuade people to use water more wisely, one approach is to give them tailored information about their water use and about other people's usage. Investigating this approach, a mobile application was implemented to explore the role of three different sources of information (weather, expert's advice and community information). Based on the evaluation, several themes for designing mobile technology for gardeners were identified. Findings from the study show that gardeners want more tailored messages from the system, and advice should come from more than one source of information, to have a greater opportunity to persuade.

Title: Generic functionality in user interfaces for emergency response

Abstract: In this paper we use findings from a number of empirical studies involving different emergency response actors to identify shared or overlapping needs for user interfaces functionality. By analyzing the findings from these studies, we have identified 11 categories of functionality supporting shared needs, including functionality for handling incident information, logging facilities, and functionality for managing human resources and equipment. After presenting our research method, we give an overview of the identified categories of shared functionality. We also describe one of the categories, namely resource management, in some more detail including giving examples of concrete user interface functionality. We have validated the conclusions of our findings through observations and interviews in a training exercise. The validation supported our prediction that the exercise would not reveal major additional categories of functionality, and it also supplemented the earlier findings regarding which actors that need which categories of functionality. We conclude by discussing pros and cons of using generic solutions supporting shared functionality across emergency response actors.

Title: Seek and Sign: an early experience of the joys and challenges of software design with young deaf children

Abstract: This paper describes the initial stages of a research project aimed at teaching preliterate Deaf children Australian sign language (Auslan) using a software application deployed on a mobile technology device. We discuss the user centred design techniques to be used in this project, specifically Gestural Think Aloud Protocol and the Problem Identification Picture Cards method. An initial design session exploring the feasibility of the design approach suggests that the approach is suitable and desirable. Our design questions for future development are listed.

Title: Search or explore: do you know what you're looking for?

Abstract: This paper explores the distinctions between searching and exploring when looking for information. We propose that, while traditional search engines work well in supporting search behaviour, they are more limited in assisting those who are looking to explore new information, especially when the exploration task is ill-defined. We ran a pilot study using two systems: one based on a traditional database search engine, and the other -- a highly innovative, engaging and playful system called iFISH -- that we designed specifically to support exploration through the use of user preferences. We looked for evidence to support the concept that exploration requires a different kind of interaction. The initial results report a positive response to our exploration system and indicate the differences in preferences amongst users for systems that match their searching or exploring behaviours.

Title: Mobile banking customization via user-defined tags

Abstract: In this paper, we describe on-going work on mobile banking customization, particularly in the Australian context. The use of user-defined tags to facilitate personalized interactions in the mobile context is explored. The aim of this research is to find ways to improve mobile banking interaction. Customization is more significant in the mobile context than online due to factors such as smaller screen sizes and limited software and hardware capabilities, placing an increased emphasis on usability. This paper explains how user-defined tags can aid different types of customization at the interaction level. A preliminary prototype has been developed to demonstrate the mechanics of the proposed approach. Potential implications, design decisions and limitations are discussed with an outline of future work.

Title: Quality delivery of mobile video: in-depth understanding of user requirements

Abstract: The increase of powerful mobile devices has accelerated the demand for mobile videos. Previous studies in mobile video have focused on understanding of mobile video usage, improvement of video quality, and user interface design in video browsing. However, research focusing on a deep understanding of users' needs for a pleasing quality delivery of mobile video is lacking. In particular, what quality-delivery mode users prefer and what information relevant to video quality they need requires attention. This paper presents a qualitative interview study with 38 participants to gain an insight into three aspects: influencing factors of user-desired video quality, user-preferred quality-delivery modes, and user-required interaction information of mobile video. The results show that user requirements for video quality are related to personal preference, technology background and video viewing experience, and the preferred quality-delivery mode and interactive mode are diverse. These complex user requirements call for flexible and personalised quality delivery and interaction of mobile video.

Title: Gestural navigation in Google Earth

Abstract: Geographical Information Systems (GISs) are playing an increasingly important role in society. Not only have the capabilities of GIS packages expanded, but their spectrum has been widened by the popularisation of software such as Google Earth, which has added an extra dimension to navigation, while still using the same interaction method. We argue that traditional GIS interfaces limit productivity by not being sufficiently intuitive to new users and by causing extra delay due to unnecessary modality. As a step on the road to solving these problems, we propose an ideal gesture-based system and present the results of a mostly qualitative user-experiment on our current prototype for gestural navigation in Google Earth, which back up our assumptions about the importance of gestural interactions being both bimanual and simultaneous.

Title: The transmission of self: body language availability and gender in videoconferencing

Abstract: Videoconferencing technology is increasingly used for work and personal use. While a lot of research has been done on the perceptual qualities of videoconferencing systems, little research has been done on self-transmission or the ways in which individuals manage and control the impressions received by the communication partner.In an experimental study with 134 participants, we investigated the influence of the availability of body language and both partners' gender on the ability to transmit oneself in videoconferencing. We found that participant gender and partner gender both had significant effects on perceptions of dominance/persuasion and impression management. We discuss these results in relation to the transmission of self in remote communication and their implications for future design and research.

Title: A tuplespace event model for mashups

Abstract: Inter-widget communication is essential for enterprise mashup applications. To implement it, current mashup platforms use the publish/subscribe pattern. However, the way publish/subscribe is used in these platforms requires a lot of manual wiring between widgets. In this paper, we propose a new Unified Widget Event Model (UWEM), which is conceptually an extension of Linda tuplespaces. UWEM separates event publishers and subscribers in space, time, and reference. Using the Keyboard-Level Model (KLM) we show that UWEM requires fewer operations to build typical mashups than conventional mashup platforms. We have implemented UWEM in a popular enterprise mashup framework, and performed an empirical study that compares UWEM with the established approach for creating mashups. The study confirms the KLM predictions, and shows that UWEM is significantly more efficient than the established approach.

Title: Supporting young children's communication with adult relatives across time zones

Abstract: Regular contact between children and their adult relatives can be a problem if they live in different time zones. In this situation, finding an agreed time to contact each other can be both confusing and complicated. This paper presents a study of the effect of time zone differences on communication between grandparents and grandchildren living in different time zones. We deployed a system between time zone distributed families to study this effect and analysed its use based on four parameters of time and events based theory: rigid sequential structures (that some events cannot occur before others), fixed durations (that most events always last the same time), standard temporal locations (that events have a standard time when they occur during the day) and uniform rates of recurrence (that some events always reoccur at a uniform rate). Our findings highlight the importance of: the need to consider the parents' role in facilitating contact and making the technology easy to use by children independently; the advantage of concurrent synchronous and asynchronous interaction forms; and the need to respect people's private time. These findings can inform the design of technology for supporting young children's communications with adult relatives across time zones.

Title: Collecting cross-cultural user data with internationalized storyboard survey

Abstract: Globalization and the search for experiential aspects of technology products and services have increased the demand for cross-cultural user feedback. Remote methods would suit agile global data collection, but only few common practices yet exist. Thus, the goal of the present study was to determine ways in which common visual stimulus material (internationalized storyboards) are perceived similarly and differently by cross-cultural respondents. An internationalized remote online storyboard survey was designed to collect cross-cultural user data of 252 respondents, from the USA, Brazil, India, Italy and Finland -- around the topic of mobile content sharing concepts. It was found that, for the majority of situations and details, storyboards supported a similar interpretation by users from different cultural backgrounds; and internationalized pictures assisted respondents in providing rich answers to a long survey because of a sound understanding of the intended situations and ease of imagining themselves in different usage situations.

Title: Expressive interactions: tablet usability for young mobile learners

Abstract: In this paper we examine the usability of tablets for students in middle school in the context of mobile environmental education. Our study focuses on the expressive qualities of three input methods -- text, audio and drawing -- and the extent to which these methods support on-task behaviour. In our study 28 small groups of children were given iPads and asked to record ecological observations from around their schoolyard. The effectiveness of the devices and their core utility for expressive, on-task data capture is assessed.

Title: Biases and interaction effects in gestural acquisition of auditory targets using a hand-held device

Abstract: A user study explored bias and interaction effects in an auditory target tracking task using a hand-held gestural interface device for musical sound. Participants manipulated the physical dimensions of pitch, roll, and yaw of a hand-held device, which were mapped to the sound dimensions of musical pitch, timbre, and event density. Participants were first presented with a sound, which they then had to imitate as closely as possible by positioning the hand-held controller. Accuracy and time-to-target were influenced by specific sounds as well as pairings between controllers and sounds. Some bias effects in gestural dimensions independent of sound mappings were also found.

Title: Awareness to improve interaction: design of distance learning environment

Abstract: This paper investigates the appropriate region to place the remote scene in a synchronous distance learning environment to attain lecturer's awareness towards students' activities. We carried out experiments aimed to engineer the new design environment that improves current distance learning classrooms by finding the relationship between human factors and design parameter. We hypothesized that it is easiest to recognize remote students' actions when the remote scene is located in lecturer's visual field, and closer to where he/she regularly puts his/her attention. We found that performance involving visual ability could be divided into 3 groups; near fixation (below 51° horizontally and below 80° laterally), far from fixation but within visual field, and out of visual field. The main contributions of this paper are the numerical evidence of visual ability and a framework of design that were derived from the experiments. We also provided design example of distance learning classroom that matches our findings.

Title: Careless touch: a comparative evaluation of mouse, pen, and touch input in shape tracing task

Abstract: This short paper is a work-in-progress report on an experimental, exploratory comparison and evaluation of three input methods (mouse, pen, and touch-input) in a line-tracing task. A method to compare the original shape and user-generated version is presented. Measurements of user efficiency and accuracy showed that participants replicating a particular shape using touch-input performed the worst in terms of accuracy but were the fastest in comparison to the remaining input methods. No effect of controlled visual feedback was observed. Additionally, subjective operational biases were observed that, together with input method and expected shape related issues, might strongly affect the results.

Title: Sound parameters for expressing geographic distance in a mobile navigation application

Abstract: This paper presents work on finding acoustic parameters suitable to convey a sense of difference in geographic distance through the concepts of "near", "middle" and "far". The context for use is a mobile application for navigation services. A set of acoustic parameters was selected based on how sound naturally travels through and is dispersed by the atmosphere. One parameter without direct acoustic connection to distance was also selected. Previous works corroborate the choice of parameters in the context of the project. Results show that modulating multiple parameters simultaneously to express distance gives a more robust experience of difference in distance compared to modulating single parameters. The ecological parameters low-pass filter and reverb gave the test's subjects the most reliable and consistent experience of difference in distance. Modulating the parameter pitch alone was seen to be an unreliable method. Combining the pitch parameter with the reverb parameter gave more robust results.

Title: An inspection on a deck for sound design in games

Abstract: In the context of an initiative to empower non-expert practitioners to perform sound design in games, assisted by a pattern language approach, it is helpful to hold an instrument that fosters the contact with the design patterns. With such purpose, we have been working on a deck of cards, which is also subject to an appreciation for sound explorations as an integral part of game design. We present the current rationale for the design of the deck, evidencing its suitability to maintain sound design opportunities at reach, in an expeditious and non-intrusive manner. We also report an exercise of inspection of the deck, aiming at a first refinement through the identification of foremost hindrances in terms of perception and content interpretation.

Title: RaPScoM: towards composition strategies in a rapid score music prototyping framework

Abstract: Especially in the low-budget and amateur score music production workflow the triangular communication between editor, director and composer is constrained by limited resources, tight schedules and the lack of common domain knowledge. Often sound-a-like ideas and precomposed material end up as static temp tracks in the rough cut and thus limit the flexibility in the composition process. Our rapid score music prototyping framework RaPScoM aims at supporting the workflow with a toolchain for semi-automated and customizeable temp track generation by exposing a set of high-level parameters based on semantic movie annotation derived from movie clip analysis and a set of basic composition rules that could be derived from exemplary (score) music. In this paper we give an overview of the framework architecture and discuss technical details on our semantic movie annotation strategy and some core composition components.

Title: A climate of fear: considerations for designing a virtual acoustic ecology of fear

Abstract: This paper proposes a framework that incorporates fear, acoustics, thought processing and digital game sound theory; with the potential to not only improve understanding of our relationship with fear, but also generate a foundation for reliable and significant manipulation of the fear experience. A brief literature review provides the context for a discussion of fear and sound in virtual worlds before the framework is described; concluding remarks point to future empirical work testing and refining the framework.

Title: Towards a conceptual framework to integrate designerly and scientific sound design methods

Abstract: Sound design for interactive products is rapidly evolving to become a relevant topic in industry. Scientific research from the domains of Auditory Display (AD) and Sonic Interaction Design (SID) can play a central role in this development, but in order to make its way to market oriented applications, several issues still need to be addressed. Building on the sound design process employed at the Sound Perception and Design (SPD) team at Ircam, and the information gathered from interviews with professional sound designers, this paper focuses on revealing typical issues encountered in the design process of both science and design oriented communities, in particular the development of a valid and revisable, yet innovative, design hypothesis. A second aim is to improve the communication between sound and interaction designers. In order to address these challenges, a conceptual framework, which has been developed using both scientific and designerly methods, was presented and evaluated using expert reviews.

Title: Making gamers cry: mirror neurons and embodied interaction with game sound

Abstract: In this paper, I draw on an embodied cognition approach to describe how sound mediates our identification with and empathy for video game characters. This identification is discussed in terms of mirror neurons and body schema, drawing on theoretical and empirical research to explore ways in which identity is created from our embodied interaction with sound. I conclude by suggesting ways in which sound designers and composers can use this information to create more empathy and identification between players and their game characters.

Title: Towards an open sound card: bare-bones FPGA board in context of PC-based digital audio: based on the AudioArduino open sound card system

Abstract: The architecture of a sound card can, in simple terms, be described as an electronic board containing a digital bus interface hardware, and analog-to-digital (A/D) and digital-to-analog (D/A) converters; then, a soundcard driver software on a personal computer's (PC) operating system (OS) can control the operation of the A/D and D/A converters on board the soundcard, through a particular bus interface of the PC - acting as an intermediary for high-level audio software running in the PC's OS.This project provides open-source software for a do-it-yourself (DIY) prototype board based on a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), that interfaces to a PC through the USB bus - and demonstrates full-duplex, mono 8-bit/44.1 kHz soundcard operation. Thus, the inclusion of FPGA technology in this paper -- along with previous work with discrete part- and microcontroller- based designs -- completes an overview of architectures, currently available for DIY implementations of soundcards; serving as a broad introductory tutorial to practical digital audio.

Title: GPU-based acoustical occlusion modeling with acoustical texture maps

Abstract: Although the direct path between a sound source and a receiver is often occluded, sound may still reach the receiver as it diffracts ("bends") around the occluding obstacle/object. Diffraction is an elementary means of sound propagation yet, despite its importance, it is often ignored in virtual reality and gaming applications altogether except perhaps for trivial environments. Given the widespread use and availability of computer graphics hardware and the graphics processing unit (GPU) in particular, GPUs have been successfully applied to other, non-graphics applications including audio processing and acoustical diffraction modeling. Here we build upon our previous work that approximates acoustical occlusion/diffraction effects in real-time utilizing the GPU. In contrast to our previous approach, the audio properties of an object are stored as a texture map and this allows the properties to vary across the surface of a model. The method is computationally efficient allowing it to be incorporated into real-time, dynamic, and interactive virtual environments and video games where the scene is arbitrarily complex.

Title: Identification of perceptual qualities in textural sounds using the repertory grid method

Abstract: This paper is about exploring which perceptual qualities are relevant to people listening to textural sounds. Knowledge about those personal constructs shall eventually lead to more intuitive interfaces for browsing large sound libraries. By conducting mixed qualitative-quantitative interviews within the repertory grid framework ten bi-polar qualities are identified. A subsequent web-based study yields measures for inter-rater agreement and mutual similarity of the perceptual qualities based on a selection of 100 textural sounds. Additionally, some initial experiments are conducted to test standard audio descriptors for their correlation with the perceptual qualities.

Title: Towards equalization of environmental sounds using auditory-based features

Abstract: In this paper we describe methods to assist soundscape design, sound production and processing for interactive environments, like games and simulations. Using auditory filter banks and sound texture synthesis, we develop algorithms that can be integrated with existing audio engines and can additionally support the development of dedicated high-level audio tools aimed at content authoring or transformations based on samples. The relationship between the auditory excitation patterns and the computation algorithm is explained within the context of footstep sounds. Moreover, methods for sound texture synthesis of water streams with artificial expansion of timbre space using auditory filtering techniques are presented.

Title: Eighth-notes performances: kinds of inégalité

Abstract: From a technical perspective the impression of inégalité in musical pulse mainly refers to aspects of timing, loudness, and duration. Musicians tend to model these performance parameters intuitively and listeners seem to perceive them, to a certain degree, unconsciously.Expert musicians and non-experts were asked to interactively tune performance parameters in a short four-bar phrase. A recently developed performance synthesis tool furnished the technical base for this analysis. The results give insight into the relationships between performance parameters and give rise to discuss the role of expertise and skill in a slightly different light. Although the analysis of appropriate performance parameters is difficult, the need for it is still beyond question for the improvement of liveliness in synthetic performances.

Title: Artist filtering for non-western music classification

Abstract: The "album effect" is a known phenomenon in musical artist and genre recognition. Classification results are often better when songs from the same album are used in the training and evaluation data sets. Supposedly, this effect is caused by the production conditions of the album, e.g. recording quality, mixing and equalization preferences, effects etc. This behavior is not representative of real world scenarios, though, and should therefore be avoided when evaluating the performance of a classifier.The related "artist effect" also affects the results of genre recognition. It is caused by the appearance of the same artists in the training and evaluation data sets. Artist filters have been proposed previously to remove this influence. We perform three different experiments to characterize the "artist effect" somewhat better and to analyze it in conjunction with non-western music. First, we test the effect's influence on the classification of musical pieces into their regions of origin. We then repeat this experiment using only specific sets of features (for the timbre, rhythm, and tonality domains). Finally, we perform a finer genre recognition with genres from four different world regions. The influence of the aforementioned effect is evaluated for all experiments.

Title: Sonic perceptual crossings: a tic-tac-toe audio game

Abstract: The development of audio-only computer games imposes a number of challenges for the sound designer, as well as for the human machine interface design approach. Modern sonification methods can be used for effective data and game-environment or conditions representation through sound, including earcons and auditory icons. In this work we take advantage of earcons fundamental characteristics, such as spatialization usually employed for concurrent/parallel reproduction, in order to implement a tic-tac-toe audio game prototype. The proposed sonic design is transparently integrated with a novel user control/interaction mechanism that can be easily implemented in state-of-the-art mobile devices incorporating movement sensors (i.e. accelerometers and gyroscope). The overall prototype design efficiency is assessed in terms of the employed sonification accuracy, while the playability achieved through the integration of the sonic design and the employed auditory user interface is assessed in real game-play conditions.

Title: An RSS-feed auditory aggregator using earcons

Abstract: In this work we present a data sonification framework based on parallel/concurrent sonic earcons' representations for monitoring in real-time information related to stock market. The information under consideration is conveyed through the well-known Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed Internet mechanism and includes both text and numeric values, converted to speech and earcons using existing speech synthesis techniques and sonic design guidelines. Due to the considered application characteristics, particular emphasis is provided on information representation concurrency, mainly achieved using sound source spatialization techniques and different timbre characteristics. Spatial positioning of sound sources is performed through typical binaural processing and reproduction. A number of systematic, subjective assessments performed have shown that the overall perceptual efficiency and sonic representation accuracy fulfills the overall application requirements, provided that the users are appropriately trained prior to using the proposed RSS-feed auditory aggregator.

Title: How to not hit a virtual wall: aural spatial awareness for collision avoidance in virtual environments

Abstract: Compared to graphics, sound is still an underused modality for conveying information and providing users with more than just general ambience or targeted sound effects. Collision notification is one case of direct aural feedback: The moment a user hits a wall, they hear an appropriate sound e.g. a thump. We tried to go further by using contextual spatial sound to provide collision avoidance feedback, which plays continuously in the background, but, unlike ambient soundscapes, reacts accurately and in real-time to upcoming collision hazards. In a first experimental design, we provided directional spatial sound feedback for collision avoidance in a prototypical labyrinth environment and examined the performance and reactions of a group of test subjects, who navigated through the labyrinth. Our initial design already received positive reactions from the subjects and analysis of the performance data shows first results indicating the viability of this kind of spatial sound feedback.

Title: Auditory feedback in an interactive rhythmic tutoring system

Abstract: We present the recent developments in the design of audio-visual feedback in iPalmas, the interactive Flamenco rhythm tutor. Based on evaluation of the original implementation, we have re-designed the interface to better support the user in learning and performing rhythmic patterns. The system measures the performance parameters of the user and provides auditory feedback on the performance with different sounds corresponding to different performance attributes. The design of these sounds is informed by several attributes derived from the evaluation. We propose informative, non-intrusive. and archetypal sounds to be used in the system.

Title: Designing alarm sounds for the control of a hydraulic platform

Abstract: The design of alarm sounds is a subtle yet important challenge. Our conceptions and stereotypes of what alarm sounds sound like are usually quite entrenched, which may be limiting the acceptance of new alarm sounds into the domain of traditional ones. This paper presents the design approaches undertaken for the case of redesigning a set of alarm and notification sounds. An analysis of the approaches' effectiveness, some design decisions, and other challenges faced are presented herein, while preliminary feedback on their effectiveness is discussed.

Title: The universal user interface: the web browser as top candidate?

Abstract: The talk will contend that the only graphical user interface that HCI practitioners need work with is the web browser. If this is the case, then user interface design, implementation and evaluation skills can become more focussed and effective. Some of the benefits this will bring will be shown, supported by examples. The HCI experts of the future will require training in the software architecture of the Web. The Web software architecture will require changes of a radical kind, and this evolution will be discussed in terms of the new web services that must become available. Recent trends in this direction will be presented, and future trends explored, with supporting evidence taken from a range of applications. The influence of the Web, with now a long history of user experience, can bring the HCI discipline to richer and more visible heights.

Title: Examining effects of acoustic feedback on perception and modification of movement patterns in on-water rowing training

Abstract: This paper describes a concept for providing acoustic feedback during on-water training to elite rowers and its implementation into the training process. The final aim was to improve the mean boat velocity by a reduction of intra-cyclic interruptions in the boat acceleration. It was assumed to enhance athletes' perception for the modification of movement patterns and control in technique training because sound conveys time-critical structures subliminally. That is of crucial importance for the precision of modifying movements to improve their execution. Advances in technology allow the design for innovative feedback systems to communicate feedback information audibly to athletes. The acoustic feedback system Sofirow was designed and field-tested with elite athletes. The device presents the boat acceleration-time trace audibly and online to athletes and coaches. The results showed a significant increase in the mean boat velocity during the sections with acoustic feedback compared to the sections without. It is thus very supportive to implement acoustic feedback regularly into training processes for elite athletes. A behavioral dynamics approach was invoked to provide a theoretical basis for this concept.

Title: Development and application of large interactive display surfaces

Abstract: Recent hardware developments have made possible the construction of relatively inexpensive large interactive display surfaces (LIDS). We have built prototype systems with office whiteboard sized displays using off-the-shelf data projectors and pen digitising equipment. Our group is investigating the use of these prototype systems in a variety of situations, including: programming, teaching, and both local and remote meeting support.The challenge of this research is to provide a style of user interaction in which the computer is an unobtrusive support agent -- offering assistance, recording and replaying data -- but not distracting from the interaction between people using the system.

Title: Extending the value of prototypes with Panorama a tool to browse software artefacts

Abstract: This paper reviews the value of prototypes and proposes a tool called Panorama that links prototypes with other artefacts created during the software development process. The artefacts we consider have been created by either HCI specialists or software engineers during software development. Panorama facilitates the sharing of artefacts and aims to increase the quality of communication between software engineers and HCI specialists throughout the development and maintenance phases. We look at a variety of prototypes created by HCI specialists including static prototypes (bitmaps of sketches, screen dumps, and digital photographs) and dynamic prototypes (derived from UIML specifications). We investigate the value and feasibility of creating links between these prototypes and other design artefacts.

Title: Menus or buttons: an evaluation of two radio telephones

Abstract: Many electronic devices have a great deal of functionality. The challenge for the user interface designer is to provide access to all the functions in the most intuitive and efficient manner. In this paper we look at two models of a radio telephone with similar functionality but with quite different interfaces: one involving dedicated buttons and the other a menu system. We describe the result of user trials and summarise the advantages and disadvantages of menus versus buttons.

Title: Issues in running software usability studies on older users

Abstract: The issues in running software usability studies involving older people are discussed with reference to experience gained in a recent successful development project. It was found that older people have special needs that require consideration when designing and carrying out usability studies. However the paper concludes that careful attention to such issues makes an important difference to the quality of information obtained from usability studies and hence the viability of the final product.

Title: Pitfalls and perspectives in context-awareness

Abstract: Despite increasing interest in context-aware artifacts we are still far from understanding the full complexity of making use of context. In this paper, we attempt to contribute to clarifying the notion of context by making an explicit distinction between context and situation which we understand as a social construct in the first place. In particular, we argue that some of the difficulties with artifacts making use of context arise because of the fundamental difference between context as a description of a situation and the situation itself: while the situation is open to (re-)negotiation, the opportunity is lost once the situation has been codified as context.

Title: Objects that create their own context: the inclusion of conception in the mental model of the user

Abstract: One of the most important aspects of User Interface Design is making provision for the mental model of the User. To date, in the literature, the mental model has been defined as the beliefs, assumptions, and perceptions of the User. This paper extends current notions of the User's mental model by also including the (future-oriented nature of) User conception. When the User Interface Design makes provision for the User's conception then objects on the screen create their own context for the simple reason that the focus of attention of conception is on the idea 'behind' the object. An exploration of the idea then becomes the basis of the future actions of the User.

Title: Extending UML to support user interface design

Abstract: The long term aim of this research is more complete integration of HCI and software engineering methods. It currently involves two distinct projects, the common thread being UML use case modelling. Project 1 is concerned with the mapping of tasks to dialogue structure. Project 2 is examining UML use case modelling from the viewpoint of its suitability as input to the early stages of the visual design of graphical user interfaces. It remains to bring the work together into an integrated method.

Title: User perceptions of website design in the travel industry: an evaluation model

Abstract: Travel agents are under pressure as the Internet enables airlines to bypass the agents' intermediary role. Creating a web presence and adopting Internet commerce cannot guarantee that those agents survive. An instrument is developed and tailored to measure the effectiveness of (Travel Agent) web sites based on earlier e-commerce site evaluation models. A survey was used to compare user reactions to the sites. A key finding of this analysis is that there is no correlation between 'better' websites (using the web analysis model) and how frequently users visit those websites. The research also indicates that the branding or reputation of the travel organisation is the main influence of visit intention and the making of e-commerce transactions. Recommendations are made to the agents to improve the effectiveness of their sites. These include design issues such as ensuring that all elements of the marketing mix (product, price, promotion, place) are present, that revisit techniques are used, that the site pays attention to build trust by providing Legal, Privacy and Security statements, and that the site's URL is advertised as part of any advertising strategy.

Title: The important features of mobile phones: how context affects user evaluation?

Abstract: The aim of this study was to find out what kind of features (functional or design aspects) real users evaluate. A secondary interest was to study how the context picture affects user evaluation of the requested features of a mobile phone. The purpose of the pictures was to create an impression of a certain context, in which the phones could be used. Two pictures were shown and the subjects were asked to mark the five features they considered important and five that they considered non-important. 36 subjects representing many different professions participated, and clear preferences were found. It seems that the idea of context was at some levels understood because the results of the two pictures were different.

Title: FreeForm: informal form design on a large interactive display surface

Abstract: This paper describes the requirements for software to create a sketch interface for Visual Basic form design using a digital whiteboard. Freehand sketching is the preferred first prototype method for most designers. A large interactive display surface provides an ideal environment for informal group design work. The completed design can be directly converted into a working Visual Basic form. This software is intended for student programmers; it is contended that providing an electronic design space will encourage them to focus on interface design as a separate and important part of program design.

Title: Historical map polygon and feature extractor

Abstract: Polygon and attribute data extraction from historical maps such as US insurance atlases from the 19th and early 20th centuries has so far been a manual task. The New York Public Library (NYPL) currently relies on staff and volunteer work to manually extract polygons and other attribute data from its collection to create new public data sets for the study of urban history. This is a time-intensive task requiring up to several minutes to trace a shapefile and transcribe attributes for a single building. In this paper we propose an approach to automatically extract such attribute data from historical maps. The approach makes use of multiple image processing and statistics utilities to produce desirable results in a fraction of the time required to do by hand.On average, a shapefile for an atlas sheet is generated in ~11.4 minutes for a total of 23.5 hours of processing time for a whole atlas that contains ~55,000 polygons; contrast this time frame to NYPL's current manual process that has taken three years to extract about 170,000 polygons across four New York City street atlases.Even with some error rate in the proposed approach, the most cumbersome, time-intensive work (manual polygon drawing) has been reduced to a fraction of its original scope. This new workflow has promising implications for historical GIS.

Title: The global solar and wind atlas: a unique global spatial data infrastructure for all renewable energy

Abstract: The Global Solar and Wind Atlas (GA) is a unique Global Spatial Data Infrastructure (GSDI) that aims to connect and bring together in a common platform the major databases and information sources around the world in the field of solar and wind energy. The initiative will be expanded to encompass all renewable energies by 2015, and will be the largest information source on renewable energy potentials ever created. It has been developed under the umbrella of the Global Atlas initiative led by IRENA in partnership with the Clean Energy Ministerial. The GSDI is based on open standards and open source and composed by fundamental datasets, a geospatial catalogue and a Web based GIS Interface. The GIS interface provides a way of interaction between users and the other components, including spatial data and tools. The GIS allows users to identify opportunity areas for renewable energy development by searching and loading data listed by the catalogue, overlaying information, and computing locally the technical potential of renewable energy. In this demonstration we aim to show the GA infrastructure and how users can interact with all the different modules with emphasis on the GIS interface.

Title: Assessing end-user interaction for multi-criteria local search with heatmap and icon-based visualizations

Abstract: Nowadays local search services are essential to provide access to geographic entities and to satisfy users' spatial information needs. While the users of these services can look for the entities of interest on map interface via sequential search or browsing of individual categories, the visualization of multiple categories simultaneously is still not well supported. This limits the end users on abstracted view, exploration, and comparison of spatial areas with respect to multiple criteria of interests. In this research we investigate the end-user interaction for multi-criteria local search with two popular representations such as aggregated pixel and icon based visualizations. We present a grid-based interactive interface where users can select multiple criteria of interests and explore the relevant spatial regions via aggregated heatmap visualizations. We evaluate the design against icon/marker based visualization, which is an easy adaption of current commercial local search interfaces. We found that heatgrid visualization for local search performs as good as the more popular marker based interface. We report our findings on both visualizations regarding several user-centered aspects such as exploration ability, information overload and cognitive demand.

Title: Interfacing real-time ozone information

Abstract: In this paper we report an interesting case of disagreement, within a design team and the user base, about how to interface real-time ozone information in a mobile app. High levels of ozone are harmful to health. They are the result of pollution under certain environmental conditions. Until recently only a categorical qualitative description was possible for an entire metropolitan area. With the proliferation of environmental sensor networks installed by the federal and local governments, real-time quantitative and localized ozone information has become available. Although this is fundamentally a different type of information with respect to the legacy one, stakeholders appear split when it comes to changing the interfacing scheme. It is a powerful example of the hold of tradition and the dilemmas it precipitates in design. It also opens the discussion about interfacing newly-minted real-time spatio-temporal information for a wide range of pollutants and irritants (from particulates to pollen).

Title: The effects of 2D and 3D maps on learning virtual multi-level indoor environments

Abstract: It is known that people have problems when wayfinding in multi-level buildings. We propose that this challenge is largely due to development of inaccurate multi-level cognitive maps of the 3D building structure. We argue that better visualization of the layered structure of the building could facilitate multi-level cognitive map development and significantly improve spatial behaviors requiring cross-floor knowledge. To address this issue, we compare two viable mobile digital visualization methods (2D top-down view maps and 3D bird's eye view maps), each showing users' real-time position as they navigated. Participants first learned a multi-level virtual building using each of these conditions, as well as a third control (non-assisted) condition. Their task was to find and learn four targets situated at two different landmark types (e.g., contiguous landmarks that were vertically aligned on each floor and non-contiguous landmarks that had no obvious alignment between floors). Participants then took part in three cross-level testing tasks performed without the map assistant used during learning: pointing between targets, vertical navigation (e.g., navigate from point A on floor 1 to the corresponding vertically aligned point on floor 2) and paper-based drilling (e.g., drawing circles to indicate floor 1's target locations on floor 2's layout). Preliminary results showed that both 2D and 3D map significantly improved pointing and vertical navigation accuracy compared to the control condition with no map assistance. However, no significant differences were found for either condition between the two map conditions. By contrast, in the paper-based drilling task, users showed significantly higher accuracy in the 2D map condition than in both the 3D map and control conditions, giving 2D interactive maps the advantage for supporting multi-level spatial behaviors.

Title: The influence of gaze history visualization on map interaction sequences and cognitive maps

Abstract: The restricted spatial context of mobile devices with small displays often makes orientation on mobile maps very difficult. In this paper we highlight and discuss the advantages of a proposed interaction concept called GeoGazemarks that can be used to facilitate orientation by utilizing the history of a user's visual attention as a visual clue. We present novel results of the analyses of interaction sequences and cognitive sketches collected during a user study with 40 participants. In addition, we correlate the increase in efficiency gained by GeoGazemarks with participants' self-reported spatial abilities, revealing significant negative correlations between spatial abilities, time efficiency gain and interaction sequences length.

Title: Flexible route guidance through turn instruction graphs

Abstract: This paper provides a detailed description of work in progress on the algorithmic challenges of generating textual route guidance. More specifically, we show how to transform the generation of meaningful turn instructions into a path search problem on a graph. We develop a thorough algorithmic framework with well-defined data structures. Subsequently, we show how to use this algorithmic framework in a way that gives flexible route guidance reflecting either user preferences of personal local knowledge. The structural properties of the graph allow us to generate guidance along the route in time linear in the number of junctions on the computed routes in theory and within milliseconds in practice. As the results are preliminary some of the explanations are given by example.

Title: Interacting with multi-perspective views: challenges and approaches

Abstract: This paper discusses challenges and approaches of interaction and navigation techniques for multi-perspective views (MPVs) in the context of 3D geovirtual environments. In contrast to single-perspective views, MPVs seamlessly combine multiple views from different perspectives in one image to reduce occlusion and visual clutter while providing additional context information.3D geovirtual environments often provide a single-perspective view and use interaction techniques that are based on ray-casting. The application of ray-cast based interaction techniques for MPVs introduces a number of technical challenges. We show how existing interaction techniques can be adapted for the application to multi-perspective city panoramas. Further, we introduce interaction techniques that enable a fast and directed exploration of virtual 3D building models based on multi-perspective detail+overview visualization.

Title: Examining the impact of regional familiarity and design characteristics on use of a map-based news visualization

Abstract: We present results from two studies exploring how people use Geo-clouds, our visualization system for quickly reviewing news stories using interactive maps and extracted images from associated news images. In combination the text and image data forms a kind of collage of news information. To test this approach, we developed a Canada-centric prototype. In the first study, we assessed how familiarity with geographic region and local culture impacts the use of our system. We find that those less familiar with Canada quickly zoomed in on regions they were familiar with and remarked on image tags more frequently, while those more familiar with Canada tended to browse wider regions and to read text tags more frequently. In the second study, we explored how the ratio of text to images impacts the participant experience. We analyzed four categories of interaction behavior: zooming and panning, scanning patterns, distraction, and reading news summaries. Results show that increasing the ratio of images-to-text causes more distraction but also leads to more news summaries read. The ratio of text to images also impacted scanning behavior, with participants tending to first scan whichever tag type (images or text) was most prevalent on the map.

Title: Creating task-specific maps with map content transformations

Abstract: Many mobile applications rely on maps in some form. However, the kind of map that is needed depends on the application and also on the user. However, conventional mapping systems employ on a one-size-fits-all approach, settling on compromises that work reasonably well for many applications. In order to deliver the exact kind of map that is required in a specific situation, we introduce a method that transforms OpenStreetMap data according to scripts that can be specified by the user. The result has the same data format as the original, but is adapted to the specific use case that the writer of the script had in mind. Thus, different representations of the same base data can be constructed when it is needed. As an example case of a user group that can profit from such content transformations, we conducted a user study with blind people which shows that they can benefit from transformed maps.

Title: The San Francisco public art map application: using VGI and social media to complement institutional data sources

Abstract: The City of San Francisco is endowed with a rich variety of art in public spaces. The San Francisco Arts Commission (SFAC) alone curates over 800 pieces of public art. In addition to the SFAC holdings, there are colorful murals, landscaped parks, art monuments, street art of mysterious origin, and pieces curated by other organizations. People taking public transportation, playing in parks, reading in libraries, or performing daily tasks that take them into San Francisco's built environment see art.There is no one place to learn about all the different art freely available. Existing mobile and web applications that map art locations silo information by covering only certain categories of art such as publicly funded pieces, murals, or street art. No application uses social media as a source of art data. In contrast, the San Francisco Public Art Map presented in this paper (SFPAM at www.sfpublicart.com) is a web application that aggregates location-based publicly accessible art data in San Francisco. SFPAM addresses the gap identified in other applications.The application has three levels of art data curation: organizational, administrative, and volunteered. The project compiles art location information from disparate institutional sources that fund and curate public art. Administrative scraping of web sites and local knowledge create additional layers. Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) creates a dynamic layer of pictures and comments on public art through social media streams such as Flickr, Panoramio, Instagram, and YouTube from contributors who unknowingly take on the role of curator through posting and tagging images. Combining data from multiple curators creates a richer set of art data points for visitors and residents in San Francisco interested in public art.Assessment of SFAC's art location data reveals quality issues with positional accuracy. Some points are located miles from their actual location and multiple points are collocated. Comparison of sample points from the SFAC dataset and peer reviewed VGI suggests that VGI can improve the quality of the application dataset.

Title: Multiview user interface coordination in browser-based geovisualization environments

Abstract: Modern-day geovisualization environments are complex systems that support interactive, multi-faceted exploration of spatio-temporal data. Such systems are often composed from a number of visualization tools, each with a pre-determined function of its own, integrated together into a single user interface. Supporting real-time coordination of user interactions across multiple facets (perspectives, views, etc.) of the resulting interface is a fundamental challenge to design of effective geovisualization environments. Past research on coordinated views for geovisualization lead to the development of a number of solutions to this problem, implemented and tested in a range of software products. With the advent of browser-based geovisualization, the issue of user interface coordination became relevant once more due to the differences between semantics of JavaScript, the "lingua franca" of browser-based software, and "traditional" programming languages. This demo paper presents a novel software approach to multiview user interface coordination in browser-based geovisualization environments. This approach is inspired by the software meta-pattern called "introspective observer coordination", is implemented using pure JavaScript and JSON technologies, and is encapsulated in the form of a JavaScript library. As part of the demonstration, additional benefits of the browser-based environments are considered, including user interface coordination across multiple browser windows and multiple computers.

Title: DistanceTouch @ OpenScienceMap towards task-specific map interaction

Abstract: During the last decade, maps became ubiquitously available. However, maps are not yet recognized as fully interactive interfaces to geographic information, but rather as a background for information rendered on top of them. Possibilities for interaction are typically implemented as generic interaction methods for graphical content and it often requires complex combinations of them to get the desired information. In this paper we introduce DistanceTouch, a task-specific and intuitive query gesture for distance approximation implemented in OpenScienceMap.

Title: SMAALL: interacting with a smart home through a synchronized scale model

Abstract: In this paper, we describe an interactive 1:35 scale model of the Bremen Ambient Assisted Living Lab that can be used to monitor and control devices in a smart home, such as lights, electronic sliding doors, height-adaptable furniture and a smart wheelchair. The model consists of i) a digital display on the floor, ii) a physical model of the walls and furnishing, and iii) a touch sensor on top. The approach allows the user to directly manipulate devices through touch gestures, and avoids the need for navigation through hierarchical menus or virtual 3D worlds. The model can also be conceived as interactive map of the environment, and we discuss how such a model could provide route information for pedestrians in buildings or cities.

Title: Differences of expectation of rapport with robots dependent on situations

Abstract: An online survey for 1,200 Japanese participants from 20's to 50's was conducted to clarify what type of robot and under what situation humans expect rapport with, and explore human factors influential into these expectations. The survey was based on hypothetical situation method consisting of three situations: a vacuum robot, a pet-type robot, and a robot instructor. The results suggested that; 1) expectations of rapport with robots were dependent on types of robots and application contexts, and were directly not affected by experiences of robots; 2) these expectations were influenced by negative attitudes toward social influences of and emotional interaction with robots, and emotional sensitivity for others; 3) expectations of rapport with robots were influenced by different psychological factors dependent on robot types and application contexts.

Title: GeoSpy: a Web3D platform for geospatial visualization

Abstract: Broadband networks are key utilities in driving the information economy. In the United States multiple publicly available web APIs provide broadband service quality data by geographic location. However, views into this data have usually been two-dimensional and limited in the amount of information that they can portray at once. In this paper, we detail a location-aware Web3D application for visualization of high-dimensional georeferenced data, such as broadband quality information, on desktop and mobile devices. The application presents a wide variety of two- and three-dimensional visualization methods and uses HTML5 for novel user interaction via access to onboard location and orientation sensors on equipped devices. Considering that the application uses geospatial web APIs as a data source, we describe its applicability in domains beyond broadband. GeoSpy is hosted at http://filebox.vt.edu/users/sharni/gs

Title: PEKOPPA: a minimalistic toy robot to analyse a listener-speaker situation in neurotypical and autistic children aged 6 years

Abstract: Using a "speaker-listener" situation, we have compared the verbal and the emotional expressions of neurotypical and autistic children aged 6 years. The speaker was always a child (neurotypical or autistic); the listener was a human or an InterActor robot named Pekoppa, i.e., a small toy robot which reacts to speech expression by nodding only. The results suggest that an InterActor robot characterized by small variance nonverbal behavior better facilitate verbal and nonverbal emotional expressions of autistic children than a human. This might be related to autistic children preferences: autistic children are rather interested in minimalist objects to which they can assign mental states of their own or of others. Everything happens as if the InterActor robot could allow autistic children to elaborate a multivariate equation encoding and conceptualizing within his/her brain, and externalizing into unconscious emotion (heart rate) and conscious verbal speech (words).

Title: Tangible earth: tangible learning environment for astronomy education

Abstract: To support astronomy education, we developed a tangible learning environment called the tangible earth system. To clarify its problems, we defined an assessment framework from the aspects of curriculum guidelines, design guidelines of tangible learning environments, and epistemology of agency. Based on the analysis of our small-scale user study, we identified problems of the system in terms of location, dynamics, and correspondence parameters.

Title: Methodology for study of human-robot social interaction in dangerous situations

Abstract: Applications of robotics in dangerous domains such as search and rescue require new methodology for study of human-robot interaction. Perceived danger evokes unique human psycho-physiological factors that influence perception, cognition and behavior. Human first responders are trained for victim psychology. Apart from real-life instances of disasters, studies of robots in this environment are difficult to perform safely and systematically with sufficient controls, fidelity, and in a manner that permits exact replication. Consequently, the trend to deploy rescue robots, for example, is proceeding largely without benefit of knowing whether human victims will readily cooperate with robot rescuers. The capability to deal with unique victim psychology has not been a testable requirement. We report on the methodology of an on-going study that uses virtual reality to provide a feature-rich immersive environment that is sufficient to evoke fear-related psychological response, provides simulation capability for robots, and enables systematic study trials with automated data collection via an embedded scripting language. The methodology presented provides an effective way to study human interaction with intelligent agents embodied as robots in application domains that would otherwise be impossible in the real world.

Title: User-friendly autonomous wheelchair for elderly care using ubiquitous network robot platform

Abstract: The importance of assistive robots for elderly people is increasing to match the needs of rapidly aging world societies. This paper develops a wheelchair robot to support the movement of the elderly to decrease caregiver workloads from the perspective of physical load and time consumption. We observed the behaviors of caregivers at a private residential care home when they are wheeling elderly people in wheelchairs. The behavior includes appropriate utterances for reducing the anxieties of senior citizens based on properties of place, e.g., "Here the path is a little narrow" while passing a narrow space or "Now let's go into elevator." They also adjusted to the wheeling speed preference of each individual because their preferred speeds were different. We implemented these two functions for elderly care using the Ubiquitous Network Robot Platform that allows the management of users and environment properties. Experimental results with elderly participants at a pseudo resident home show that the seniors prefer a wheelchair robot on which the above functions have been implemented.

Title: Voice interaction system with 3D-CG virtual agent for stand-alone smartphones

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a voice interaction system using 3D-CG virtual agents for stand-alone smartphones. Because the proposed system can handle speech recognition and speech synthesis on a stand-alone smartphone differently from the existing mobile voice interaction systems, this system enables us to talk naturally without encountering delays caused by network communications. Moreover, proposed system can be fully customized by dialogue scripts, Java-based plugins, and Android APIs. Therefore, developers can make original voice interaction systems for smartphones easily based on proposed system. We have made a subset of the proposed system available as open-source software. We expect that this system will contribute to studies of human-agent interaction using smartphones.

Title: Volume adaptation and visualization by modeling the volume level in noisy environments for telepresence system

Abstract: The Lombard effect is the involuntary tendency of speakers to increase their vocal effort when speaking in a loud noise to enhance the audibility of their voice. There is a problem in telecommunication due to the Lombard effect. A speaker talks at a louder volume than necessary for the conversation partner at a remote location. This paper proposes a volume model that is required in order to automatically adjust the volume of an operator's voice at a remote communication via a telepresence robot, and develops an optimal volume control system LombaBot equipped on a telepresence robot with the model. The volume model measures the level of noise around the robot and the distance between a conversation partner and the robot to adjust the volume of the operator's voice. It has two types of volume adjustments. Those are called comfortable volume and secret talk volume. LombaBot enables people at a remote site to listen comfortably to the voice of a robot operator. Moreover, the operator is able to talk in low voices when s/he wants to talk in secret with nearby people. We confirmed that LombaBot adjusted the volume of an operator's voice properly in the noisy remote location.

Title: Personal and interactive newscaster agent based on estimation of user's understanding

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a virtual agent system that introduces the current news on the Webs depending on the user's reactions to the understanding. We focused on the gesture of the user to estimate the user's state of understanding based on the head motion. The goal of the research is the user's under- standing of the news regardless of the knowledge level. The system controls 1) the level of the news content corresponding to the user's gesture of inclining her/his head and 2) the audibility of the agent's speech (the volume and the speed) by the user's head motion to turn her/his ear to the agent. The results of the evaluations showed the effectiveness of the interactive change of the reading behaviors to be understandable and audible.

Title: Stage of subconscious interaction in embodied interaction

Abstract: Humans can interact with strangers because they can communicate with each other. On the other hand, developing a relationship with an unknown artifact is difficult. In order to address this problem, existing studies have explored various approaches to the artifact's behavioral design. However, little research has been done on interaction where there is no information about the interaction partner and where there has been no experimental task. Clarification of how people regard unknown objects as interaction partners is required. We believe that a stage of subconscious interaction plays a role in this process. We created an experimental environment to observe the interaction between a human and a robot whose behavior was actually mapped by another human. We observed this interaction under two different conditions; where the participants knew and where the participants did not know that the robot could interact. Both sets of participants approached or avoided the robot, but differences in the interaction property for each condition was confirmed. The results of our experiment suggest that a stage of subconscious interaction does exist for recognition of artifacts as interaction partners.

Title: An affective telepresence system using smartphone high level sensing and intelligent behavior generation

Abstract: A new approach in telepresence robots via automatic behavior generation is proposed in this paper. The robot behavior is generated using the Smartphone high level sensing, and personality based mood transition. The current telepresence systems require the simultaneous presence of both communication parties. Therefore, due to the time and context differences in distant communication, the opportunity of connectedness is reduced. This is especially important for more intimate telecommunications, that ongoing connectedness is more required. To solve these problems, we developed an automatic behavior generation system, that produces behaviors on behalf of the remote person. In order to be able to infer the state of the remote person more frequently and dynamically, Smartphone sensors are used for automatic high level sensing. Furthermore, to produce more believable affective expressions by the robot, the expressions correspond to the remote user's personality stereotype. Fuzzy Kohonen Clustering Network (FKCN), is utilized to linearly fuse the inferred mood states and regenerate them on the agent. To evaluate the results 120 samples of the user's Smartphone usage and the mood in different times of the day were logged. The state estimated by the model were compared against the users self report data. The results showed that there was no significant difference between the user's self-perceived feelings, and the feelings recognized by the model.

Title: Ningyo of the CAVE: robots as social puppets of static infrastructure

Abstract: In this paper, we present a view of robots as physical agents submitting to a static infrastructure, allowing a computerized static system to use the robot as a dynamic puppet, which is a social agent that can communicate on physical and social terms with its human users and visitors. We demonstrate our approach with Ningy? of the CAVE, a prototype designed to allow a virtual reality CAVE facility to introduce its capabilities to human users and visitors. Through the robot, the CAVE is able to highlight capabilities and uses of the facility through performance, showmanship and physical actions to create an engaging interaction that conveys an overview of the facility and demonstrates its key functionalities. We examine the quality of the resulting engagement with preliminary reflection by several human visitors to our CAVE system. We believe that viewing robots as components of a greater and more capable computerized ecosystem is a less explored research path in social human-robot interaction, and hope that our Ningy? of the CAVE prototype could set the stage and inform some of the future research on this topic.

Title: Emotional cyborg: complementing emotional labor with human-agent interaction technology

Abstract: The author proposes the notion of an emotional cyborg as a new application proposal in the human-agent interaction (HAI) field. This paper is a summary of what kind of human processes maintain emotional labor and how such kind of social labor is supported by HAI technologies. The author implemented AgencyGlass, a prototype application, as a tool for realizing an emotional cyborg. The device is attached on a user's face and displays the user's eye gestures. The author created a prototype application for supplementing emotional labor with AgencyGlass and presented this as a video. Reactions from media and online feedback on the prototype are analyzed, and the future of HAI applications is illustrated.

Title: Can a social robot help children's understanding of science in classrooms?

Abstract: This study investigates whether a social robot which interacts with children via quiz-style conversations increases their understanding of science classes. We installed a social robot in an elementary school science classroom where children could freely interact with it during their breaks. The robot asks children questions related to their latest science classes to support their understanding of the classes. During interaction, the robot says children's name and distribute its gaze among the group of children by using a face recognition system and a human tracking system. Still, speech recognition is difficult in the noisy elementary school environment; therefore the operator takes over this function during interactions. In this study our result did not show significant effects of the robot for helping children's understanding, but we found several interesting interaction scenes which shows that robot had a certain effect on specific children.

Title: Simplification of wearable message robot with physical contact for elderly's outing support

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a wearable message robot that transmits messages to the user and alerts him/her immediately and affectionately through physical contact. This robot is aimed at supporting elderly people who would like to participate in outings but suffer from anxiety. The system creates haptic stimuli corresponding to the user's clothing and posture. We implemented two versions of the system: the first combines haptic stimuli and anthropomorphic motion to express physical contact, while the second is a simplified system for application on smartphones to provide ubiquitous services.

Title: Assigning a personality to a spoken dialogue agent through self-disclosure of behavior

Abstract: In this study, we propose a method to assign a personality to a spoken dialogue agent and evaluate effectiveness of the method. Recently, some research studies on human-agent interaction (HAI) showed that it is possible to assign a personality by controlling non-verbal information of an agent. However, we consider that verbal information sent from an agent would result in the agent developing a personality. In this paper, we focus on self-disclosures about behavior as an important factor of assigning a personality, and analyze the effects of self-disclosures on assigning a personality to the agent by evaluation of impressions. We discovered that self-disclosures performed by the agent are as effective for personality recognition as those performed by humans. Further, self-disclosures allow a user to recognize an agent's personality, and humanlike self-disclosure does not impede personality recognition even if utterer of these self-disclosures is an agent. Based on these facts, we verified effectiveness of our proposal method to assigning a personality by self-disclosures about behavior.

Title: SB simulator: a method to estimate how relation develops

Abstract: People spend their everyday life while expecting social relations between them and the others. However, the expectation causes a trouble or a misunderstanding because they grasp the relations from their subjective viewpoint. It is useful that a computer software assists people to grasp the relations by showing the possible variations of the relation. This paper proposes a simulator named SB Simulator that accepts current relations which a user grasps and simulates the course of the development of relations between them based on Heider`s balance theory and Socion theory. The aim of SB Simulator is to make the user know what changes in the relations happen if s/he takes an action. In particular, SB Simulator generates possible initial relations before starting the simulation, which compensate for the possibility that the user grabs the current relations incorrectly from her/his subjective viewpoint. The function of generating the initial relations has a role in raising a user's awareness of the other possibilities of relations. Moreover, since SB Simulator employs Socion Theory to express the relations, it can distinguish relations which people recognize subjectively from the ones existing objectively, and simulate possible relations based on dynamics between the subjective and objective relations. The paper evaluates SB Simulator in terms of whether the results of the simulation are acceptable in contrast to the typical course of relation development. The result indicated that SB Simulator simulated the relations properly based on the initial relations.

Title: PaintBoard: prototyping interactive character behaviors by digitally painting storyboards

Abstract: The creation of interactive computer-controlled characters in interactive media is a challenging and multi-faceted task requiring the skills and effort of professionals from many fields. This work addresses authoring the interactive aspect of these characters' behaviors -- how characters act automatically in response to a dynamic user-controlled character. We present PaintBoard, a system that enables users to prototype and test discrete, real-time, interactive movements in a 2D grid environment simply by digitally painting a storyboard. We designed and developed a novel authoring technique for creating behaviors (painting storyboards) and a novel algorithm based on machine-learning, that analyzes a storyboard to create a behavior that works beyond situations provided in the input storyboard. We conducted two exploratory studies that grounded the prototype design, and present the results of a proof-of-concept workshop with game developers. Finally, we performed a comparison of machine learning algorithms' performance on our storyboard data.

Title: Modeling perception-action loops: comparing sequential models with frame-based classifiers

Abstract: Modeling multimodal perception-action loops in face-to-face interactions is a crucial step in the process of building sensory-motor behaviors for social robots or users-aware Embodied Conversational Agents (ECA). In this paper, we compare trainable behavioral models based on sequential models (HMMs) and classifiers (SVMs and Decision Trees) inherently inappropriate to model sequential aspects. These models aim at giving pertinent perception/action skills for robots in order to generate optimal actions given the perceived actions of others and joint goals. We applied these models to parallel speech and gaze data collected from interacting dyads. The challenge was to predict the gaze of one subject given the gaze of the interlocutor and the voice activity of both. We show that Incremental Discrete HMM (IDHMM) generally outperforms classifiers and that injecting input context in the modeling process significantly improves the performances of all algorithms.

Title: Nodding responses by collective proxy robots for enhancing social telepresence

Abstract: It is expected that the social presence of a distant person can be well conveyed in telecommunication using a robot as a proxy of that person. This paper proposes a novel form of robotic telecommunication, which consists not only of a proxy robot but also an additional bystander robot that autonomously responds to the interlocutor in front of them. The second robot is expected to complement the responses of the proxy robot so that the interlocutor feels stronger social telepresence of the distant person. A psychological experiment using two small humanoid robots as proxy and bystander reveals a positive effect on conveying a stronger feeling of social telepresence of the distant person.

Title: Robotic tele-presence with DARYL in the wild

Abstract: This paper describes the results of a qualitative analysis of questionnaire data collected during a public exhibition of our robotic tele-presence system. In Summer 2013 the mildly humanized robot DARYL could be tried out by the general public during our University's science fair in the city center. People were given the chance to communicate through the robot with their peers and to perceive the world through the "eyes" and "ears" of the robot by means of a head-mounted display with attached headphones. An operator's voice was instantaneously transmitted to the robot's location and his or her head movements were tracked to enable direct, intuitive control of the robot's head movements. Twenty-seven people were interviewed in a structured way about their impressions and opinions after having either operated or interacted with the tele-operated robot. A careful analysis of the acquired data reveals a rather positive evaluation of the tele-presence system and interesting opinions about suitable application areas. These findings may guide designers of robotic tele-presence systems, a research area of increasing popularity.

Title: Sharedo: to-do list interface for human-agent task sharing

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a to-do list interface for sharing tasks between human and multiple agents including robots and software personal assistants. While much work on software architectures aims to achieve efficient (semi-)autonomous task coordination among human and agents, little work on user interfaces can be found for user-oriented flexible task coordination. Instead, most of the existing human-agent interfaces are designed to command a single agent to handle specific kinds of tasks. Meanwhile, our interface is designed to be a platform to share any kinds of tasks between users and multiple agents. When agents can handle the task, they ask for details and permission to execute it. Otherwise, they try supporting users or just keep silent. New tasks can be registered not only by humans but also by agents when errors occur that can only be fixed by human users. We present the interaction design and implementation of the interface, Sharedo, with three example agents, followed by brief user feedback collected from a preliminary user study.

Title: A design model of emotional body expressions in non-humanoid robots

Abstract: Robotic emotional expressions could benefit social communication between humans and robots, if the cues such expressions contain were to be intelligible to human observers. In this paper, we present a design framework for modelling emotionally expressive robotic movements. The framework combines approach-avoidance with Shape and Effort dimensions, derived from Laban, and makes use of anatomical body planes that are general to both humanoid and non-humanoid body forms. An experimental validation study is reported with 34 participants rating an implementation of five expressive behaviours on a non-humanoid robotic platform. The results demonstrate that such expressions can encode basic emotional information, in that the parameters of the proposed design model can convey the meaning of emotional dimensions of valence, arousal and dominance. The framework thus creates a basis for implementing a set of emotional expressions that are appropriately adapted to contexts of human-robot joint activity.

Title: More human than human?: a visual processing approach to exploring believability of android faces

Abstract: The issue of believability is core to android science, the challenge of creating a robot that can pass as a near human. While researchers are making great strides in improving the quality of androids and their likeness to people, it is simultaneously important to develop theoretical foundations behind believability, and experimental methods for exploring believability. In this paper, we explore a visual processing approach to investigating the believability of android faces, and present results from a study comparing current-generation android faces to humans' faces. We show how android faces are still not quite as believable as humans, and provide some mechanisms that may be used to investigate and compare believability in future projects.

Title: A fixed pattern deviation robot that triggers intention attribution

Abstract: Attributing intention to others is a difficult task for individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). We hypothesize that individuals with ASD ascribe a lower level of abstraction to observed behavior than typically developing individuals. In this study, we discuss the development of a robot that gradually increases the level deviation from a fixed pattern behavior, inducing individuals to ascribe a greater level of abstraction to observed behavior.

Title: Potential of imprecision: exploring vague language in agent instructors

Abstract: As we find greater potential for agent instructors, we must be aware of how their language use can affect the user and interaction as a whole. This study investigates the use of intentionally imprecise or vague language as a communicative strategy to mitigate the impact of instructions. We look at the effects it has on improving the perception of agents and user performance. A series of assembly tasks were ran in which users constructed Lego models with the spoken instructions of vague and non-vague agents. Results show that though the non-vague agent was seen as more direct and authoritative, responses to other attributes and performance were much more varied. Findings suggest there is potential for vague language human-agent interaction, though there are several obstacles in agent design to overcome first.

Title: The sharing of meta-signals and protocols is the first step for the emergence of cooperative communication

Abstract: We investigated how people communicate in a situation where there is no shared languages among them. We designed "image sharing game", in which players must cooperate to solve it. The only communication media available for the players is the exchange of gestures represented by skeleton diagrams. In this game, some of the player-pairs developed not only signals for objects, but also meta-signals that controlled communication. Those with meta-signals were observed to perform better than those without meta-signals.

Title: A cooking assistant robot using intuitive onomatopoetic expressions and joint attention

Abstract: A novel cooking assistance interface is proposed that guides users in the precise timing of cooking actions by means of intuitive onomatopoetic expressions associated with different cooking states and nonverbal movements on the part of a cooking assistant robot such as focusing attention through eye-gazing and gestures. The effectiveness of the scheme is demonstrated using the system to assist subjects in preparing a familiar recipe (pancakes).

Title: Synchrony based side by side walking: an application in human-robot interactions

Abstract: Previously, we proposed a model that allows a robot to select an interacting partner and locate its focus of attention on the basis of synchrony between its own internal dynamics and the perceived visual stimuli. Here, we extend our approach for human-robot interactions in a "synchronous walking" scenario. Our inspirations come from the notion of unintentional synchrony indicated by psychology and motor coordination studies as a fundamental parameter in social interactions. When two persons walk together, unconsciously, their steps are synchronized by constantly adjusting the length and the frequency of their steps. Here, we are interested in replicating this human-human behavior in a human-robot interaction. we propose a neural network architecture that allows a robot to follow and walk synchronously with a human by adapting the robot's dynamics according to the human gait using low level motor and visual primitives.

Title: Image recognition method which measures angular velocity from a back of hand for developing a valve UI

Abstract: The training that uses virtual reality technology is expected to be useful for preventing the accidents caused by human factor. However, there is a problem that a trainee cannot train due to lack of the UI such as realizing the real valve operations in industrial plant. We propose an image recognition method to measure the valve opening manipulation velocity for developing UI to realize the training of valve manipulation in virtual environment. The method to measure the angular velocity of the circular handle uses the optical natural feature points on the handle turning the valve. The advantages of our valve manipulation UI are that one is low cost and another it can be applied to various valves with circular handle. The evaluation experiment revealed that our method could measure the angular velocity of 22.5-90 degree/s.

Title: Notification design using mother-like expressions

Abstract: People often ignore their reminders or schedulers, which notify them about their requisite tasks using monotonous message expressions, usually because they do not pay sufficient attention to their notifications and they feel that they are under no pressure to respond. In this study, we propose a notification design method that uses mother-like expressions to enhance user acceptability of notifications. Mother-like expressions are highly variable, such as euphemistic expressions and imperative forms, and notifications that use them may apply different levels of pressure on users. To implement a reminder system that provides notifications regarding various tasks using mother-like expressions, we classified tasks collected from actual reminders, schedulers, and diaries. As a result, we found that the tasks could be classified into six verb-based categories, which could be adapted using mother-like expressions.

Title: Development of a dialogue scenario editor on a web browser for a spoken dialogue system

Abstract: We developed a scenario editor to improve the environment of scenario editing for a spoken dialogue system. The purpose of this study is to improve the editing environment of the spoken dialogue system. We have developed MMDAgent (a fully open-source toolkit for voice interaction systems), which runs on a variety of platforms such as personal computers (running Windows, Mac OS, or Linux) and smartphones (running Android). So that MMDAgent can be used in a similar environment, the scenario editor is also implemented on a Web browser. Experiments were conducted for subjects using the scenario editor of our system. It was found that our system provides better readability of a scenario and allows easier editing.

Title: Will you follow the robot's advice?: the impact of robot types and task types on people's perception of a robot

Abstract: Robots could be classified into an autonomous robot and a tele-operated robot according to the levels of autonomy. As a match between robot types and task types is important, we explored the impact of robot types and task types on social presence, trustworthiness, and willingness to follow the robot's advice in art appraising situation. We executed a 2(robot types: autonomous robot vs. tele-operated robot) X 2(task types: quantitative task vs. qualitative task) mixed-participants experiment (N=30). Participants perceived more social presence toward the tele-operated robot than the autonomous robot while the autonomous robot was perceived more trustworthy than the tele-operated robot. The robot types and the task types had an interaction effect on the perceived trustworthiness and the willingness to follow the advice. Implications for the appropriate design by the robot types and the task types regarding human-robot interaction are discussed.

Title: Multimodal bodily feeling analysis to design air conditioning services for elderly people

Abstract: In order to create air conditioning service scenarios adaptive to elderly people, we have conducted detailed situational analyses focusing on bodily feeling information. The practical experimental environment has introduced our constructed indoor interaction system to understand situations based on bodily feeling and to control air conditioners properly. The experiments consists of 7 sessions participated by 6 elderly people have accumulated 228 times of bodily feeling inputs. The detailed analyses have done utilizing our developed multimodal behavior observation tool equipped with the functions of behavior description from multiple viewpoints and flexible retrieval. The analysis results indicate the possibility of correspondence of the scenes of situational changes in conversation like topic transitions and turn-taking events or those of reading to the changes of bodily feeling. The multimodal bodily feeling analysis has produced valuable findings to enhance situation understanding.

Title: Portable robot inspiring walking in elderly people

Abstract: In Japan, which has already become a super aging society, it is important that elderly people maintain their healthy condition both physically and mentally. We have developed a portable robot, "TechTech," which encourages them to take a walk. We infer that the human-robot interaction is crucially important for increasing their motivation to exercise by walking. TechTech talks to elderly people based on information obtained from various sensors: TechTech can judge weather and indoor-outdoor environments. It can also detect sounds and to count steps. It can vary the words and the intervals in conversations. Results obtained from experiments demonstrate that the impressions of dialogues with the robot differ according to a person's age. Elderly people prefer long intervals in conversations.

Title: Can you touch me?: the impact of physical contact on emotional engagement with a robot

Abstract: As a robot has both characteristics of humanness and productness, we explored which characteristic is more dominant between them. In order to explore the impact of communicator types on social presence and shyness in physical contact, we executed a 3 (communicator types: a human vs. a robot vs. a product) with-in participants experiment (N=30). Participants felt more social presence to a person than a robot, and a product. On the other hand, participants felt more shyness to a person than a product, and a robot.

Title: Social acceptance by elderly people of a fall-detection system with range sensors in a nursing home

Abstract: This study developed a fall detection system for elderly people in a nursing home and investigated their acceptance of it. The system obtained their positions and heights from range sensors and used that information to correctly detect 89.5% of the falls based on data where the elderly crouched in a mockup room of a nursing home. We investigated the social acceptance with elderly people by comparing three conditions: (1) only detecting out-of-bed, (2) detecting falls in a room and always showing the human position, and (3) detecting falls in a room and only showing the human position when a fall happened. The results showed that intention to use were significantly higher in the second and third conditions than the first condition.

Title: Recovery of virtual object contact surface features for replaying haptic feeling

Abstract: In this paper, we improve our previous work to recover the user interacting virtual object's contact surface features based on the recorded visual-haptic data for replaying haptic feeling. First the haptic stylus motion is tracked from the recorded screenshot images of the haptic virtual environment (HVE). The virtual object's contact surface can then be modeled after the coordinate transformation process which transforms the haptic stylus position from screenshot image coordinate space into the haptic coordinate space. Finally, the genetic algorithm (GA) is used to identify the contact surface physical properties.

Title: The hybrid agent MARCO: a multimodal autonomous robotic chess opponent

Abstract: This paper introduces MARCO, a hybrid, chess playing agent equipped with a custom-built robotic arm and an emotionally expressive, virtual face presented on a small, servo-controlled display. MARCO was built to investigate the hypothesis that hybrid systems capable of displaying emotions make playing chess more personal and enjoyable. In addition, it is our aim to realize emotional contagion between man and machine in that the agent has the power to influence the human player on an emotional level and vice versa. The hardware components consist of eight Dynamixel servos, an Arduino-based control board, a 5.6 inch display, and a DGT chessboard. The software components run concurrently as separate processes. The main components are the virtual agent framework MARC, the WASABI Affect Simulation architecture, and the TSCP chess engine.

Title: Emotion recognition and expression in therapeutic social robot design

Abstract: To improve the healthcare and wellbeing of the elderly population, a therapeutic social robot was designed and its interaction with human was investigated in this research. The focus is to enable the designed robot to understand human's emotion and express emotion through gestures accordingly. To identify human emotion, tactile sensors were utilized and installed on the robot's head to detect users' touch signals, and classify them into four patterns (hit, pat, stroke and unknown). The classification task was performed based on three methods (Localist Attractor Network, Temporal Decision Tree and Naive Bayes Classifier). Exploration of the trade-off between high accuracy and low computing workload was also carried out for all three methods. Four gestures were designed to respond to the four emotion recognition patterns, which can express some basic human emotional statuses such as unhappiness, love, relaxation and confusion.

Title: Affective agents for enhancing emotional experience

Abstract: We propose shared emotional experience agents. They enhance the user's emotional experience by emotional contagion. Our experiment has 12 participants watch videos together with a robot that expresses an emotional state by body and voice. The results suggest that the affective robot will make user more excited and relaxed and make user less depressed and afraid than they view it alone.

Title: Amae and agency appraisal as japanese emotional behavior: influences on agent's believability

Abstract: Recently, autonomous agents with emotional behavior are developed to improve the human-agent interaction. Users' perceived "believability" of autonomous agents is considered to affect interactions with agents. While human-like emotional behavior is considered to increase believability, actual emotional behaviors differ across cultures. Therefore culture-specific emotional behaviors of agent might increase believability. In this paper, two kinds of emotional behaviors specific in Japanese culture, namely amae and Japanese way of agency appraisal, were implemented in agents. Influences of these behaviors on believability were investigated experimentally. Results showed that both Japanese behaviors increased believability. Especially amae increased personality factor, which is one of the factors of believability.

Title: Digital play therapy for children with learning disabilities

Abstract: Children who are suffering on learning and developmental disabilities require daily trainings for social skills. However, such daily training is not provided occasionally because it requires interactive helps from therapists. In this paper, we propose a digital dollhouse that enhanced traditional psychological play therapy with digital sensors and computer graphics. The digital dollhouse provides immersive space to children which grows children's communication skill through their imaging play. This device allows non-professional like parents to make play therapy. In this paper, we show details about prototype of digital dollhouse. We also categorize requirements for digital play therapy that are given by psychological viewpoints based on the prototype. Interdisciplinary design process collaborating with engineers and psychologists shows the possibility that digital dollhouse is enough to enhance empathy of children and such empathy will be enhanced by creating immersive characters.

Title: Pointing gesture prediction using minimum-jerk model in human-robot interaction

Abstract: A pointing gesture has an important role in human-human interaction. From our observation, we predict a pointing target before finishing the gesture in human-human communication. This paper, thus, proposes a method for a robot to predict human pointing gesture using the minimum-jerk model. Analytically, the final position of a wrist can be obtained by detecting the first acceleration peak, which corresponds to first 21\% of the entire gesture. We implemented and evaluated the method with a desktop size robot named Robovie-W. The result showed that our method improves naturalness and smoothness.

Title: Weight-aware robot motion planning for lift-to-pass action

Abstract: Passing an object between two humans is a very natural and seamless operation, mainly thanks to non-verbal cues which facilitate the process. Just from action observation, humans can easily anticipate where and when a passing movement will end and how heavy the transported object is. But how could this natural understanding be ported to non-human agents? We introduce a simple robotic architecture to enable the iCub humanoid robot to visually recognize the weight of an object and select a lift-to-pass motion which implicitly communicates such information to the action partner. In this work we mainly focus on the building and training of the procedural memory module needed to store the association between the mass of an object and its visual appearance, and we propose how such a model can be used to successively select communicative lifting motions.

Title: Luminous device for the deaf and hard of hearing people

Abstract: People with hard of hearing and the deaf often face difficulties to recognize things happening in their surroundings. Imagine you cannot hear the sound, because you are with hard of hearing or using iPod with earphones, you would not able to recognize the car coming behind of you. It may cause a fatal collision. The purpose of this study is to develop the device mostly for the deaf or hard of hearing people, for persons temporarily with hard of hearing besides. The device can be applied to multi modal accessibility, which transforms the sound information to the visual information. It also provides the direction to the sound source using a light. The device is compact in an attempt to be used in everyday life.

Title: Towards better eye tracking in human robot interaction using an affordable active vision system

Abstract: Knowing where a person is looking is an important parameter of every human-human interaction. Detecting a person's gaze could significantly improve the interaction capabilities of today's robotic agents. But many robots' visual systems are limited by data bandwidth and optical hardware. We propose a low-cost high-def pan/tilt/zoom active vision system that could significantly improve the robot's eye tracking capabilities. We tested the proposed system for improving mutual gaze detection in a human-robot interaction scenario and found significant results compared to systems without zoom capability.

Title: COLUMN: persuasion as a social mediator to establish the interpersonal coordination

Abstract: We developed soccer ball-shaped interactive artifacts (COLUMN) consisting of eight modules that are connected to twelve servomotors. In the interaction, COLUMN becomes a social mediator to prompt the connectivity of the users. We claim that the above process generates a variety of user's interpersonal coordinates and these can be mapped to the shape of COLUMN's. Therefore, the motivation of our study is to extract the patterns of user's interpersonal coordination. It is also interesting to explore how these patterns lead to imagine behavior for an artifact which has different degree of freedom of its body than the existing.

Title: Dynamic dialog system for human robot collaboration: playing a game of pairs

Abstract: This paper presents results of a first study for a human-robot-interaction in which the robot Flobi autonomously plays the game 'pairs' against a human player. Integrated is a dialog system which can use different dynamic sentence structures for altering the verbal output during the interaction. The system is compared with a dialog system using static sentences with high information detail and a system using static short sentences. The results suggest that using a dynamic system results in a more satisfying gameplay.

Title: Evaluation of a video communication system with speech-driven embodied entrainment audience characters with partner's face

Abstract: We previously proposed an embodied video communication system called E-VChat, in which a computer-generated (CG) avatar is superimposed on the other talker's video image in a face-to-face scene, so that they can better comprehend their mutual interactions during remote communication. In this study, an advanced video communication system that includes audience characters showing a partner's face is proposed. This system provides a more interactive space that makes it easy to communicate by clearly distinguishing the simple audience characters from the functional substitutes of the partner. A communication experiment is performed to confirm the effectiveness of the system for 12 pairs of 24 talkers.

Title: Unification of demonstrative pronouns in a small group guided by a robot

Abstract: For realizing smooth communication, participants' viewpoints and usages of demonstrative pronouns assume an important role. Moreover, they both are strongly associated and construct a dialogue structure among participants. In this study, we investigate the relation constructed by their viewpoints and usages of demonstrative pronouns in a small group. Especially, we conducted experiments to verify whether demonstrative pronouns were unified in a small group consisted of two participants and a robot guided by the robot, and evaluate participants' psychological factors on this occasion. As a result of experiments, the unification of demonstrative pronouns in the small group guided by the robot led participants to smooth communication.

Title: Evaluating an intuitive teleoperation platform explored in a long-distance interview

Abstract: SWoOZ is an intuitive teleoperation platform using a humanoid robot as a proxy between two humans: a remote user teleoperating the robot and a local user interacting directly with it. NAO (Aldebaran) is the proxy used in this study. The remote user controls its head motion with his own movements (live) while his real voice is transmitted to the local user with an unnoticeable lag time. This paper presents a user study of the platform in the context of a long-distance survey and investigates the possible effect of the remote user's previous experience with robots on the local users' evaluation of the proxy. Although found useful, likable and satisfying by all the local users, only the ones interviewed by the non-naive user find it averagely credible. Results fail to validate an effect of the remote users' previous experience with robots on the local users.

Title: Tap model to improve input accuracy of touch panels

Abstract: In recent years, devices that use touch panels as interfaces, such as smart phones and tablet PCs, have spread. These devices have many advantages. For example, operating the panel can be done more intuitively in comparison with using conventional physical buttons, and the devices are quite more flexible than those that use a traditional fixed UI. However, mistakes frequently occur when inputting with a touch panel because the buttons have no physical boundaries and users cannot get tactile feedback with their fingers because the panels never change physically. Thus, the input accuracy of touch-panel devices is lower than that of devices with physical buttons. There are studies on improving input accuracy. Most of them use language models for typing natural language or probabilistic models to describe the errors made when users tap their fingers. However, these models are not practical, and the experiments are preliminary. Thus, in this paper, we propose a more practical model for improving input accuracy, in which the relative relationships between a target object and neighbor objects that might influence error making when touching the target are tested. We consider that our model can describe important properties for designing various UIs depending on practical applications. We also conducted preliminary experiments in order to build our model in a calibrated way and discuss our evaluation of the model.

Title: A design method using cooperative principle for conversational agent

Abstract: It is usually difficult to pre-determine the various verbal and nonverbal behaviors that an agent will exhibit in conversation. In order to develop an efficient conversational agent, a better design method is therefore required, preferably one that is relatively simple and easy to use. In this study, I propose a novel method for designing the verbal and nonverbal behaviors of conversational agents, employing the cooperative principle observed in human behavior. This paper presents examples of research related to the underlying hypothesis of the model, which asserts that humans tend to be cooperative by nature. The applicability of the proposed model for agent behavioral design is also discussed.

Title: Analysis of personality traits for intervention scene detection in multi-user conversation

Abstract: As the advance of embodied conversational agent (ECA) technologies, there are more and more real-world deployed applications of ECA's like the guides in museums or exhibitions. However, in these applications, the agent systems are usually used by groups of visitors rather than individuals. In such multi-user situation, which is more complex sophisticated than single user one, specific features are required. There can be difference in how and when to intervene in the conversation of others due to the variety of personality. In order to realize a more implement the human-like and more helpful guide agent, this work tries to explore the relationship between personality and the willing to intervene in users' conversation as the role of a guide. In this paper, the analysis results of the intervention action and personality traits are reported.

Title: Huggable communication medium encourages listening to others

Abstract: We propose a huggable communication device called Hugvie that encourages children to concentrate on listening by reducing their stress and strengthening the feeling that the storyteller is close. We observed a group of preschool children who listened to a story and conclude that Hugvie has the potential to facilitate attention on stories. This indicates its usefulness to relieve the educational problem where children show disobedient or restless behavior during class. We discuss Hugvie's effect on learning and memory and potential applications to special-needs children.

Title: Experimental study of empathy and its behavioral indices in human-robot interaction

Abstract: Similar to relationships between humans, a person desiring to form a good relationship with a robot needs to be able to empathize with it. However, the specific kinds of human-robot interactions that would arouse and enhance empathy for the robot in the user's mind have not yet been clarified. In addition, the human behavioral traits that may be regarded as indices of empathy have not been investigated extensively. In an attempt to address these two issues, a preliminary experiment on empathy in human-robot interaction is conducted. The results suggest that the actions of naming or comforting a robot could contribute to enhancing its user's empathy and that eye fixation could be used as an index of empathy even when the use of a subjective index is inconclusive.

Title: Modeling of cooperative behavior agent based on collision avoidance decision process

Abstract: Recent years, robots are useful at home such as cleaning task or communication tools. So there are a lot of studies about cooperative behavior with robots. In order to realize cooperative tasks with robots, it is necessary that robots estimate human intention from human behavior and act in the context based on the intention. In this research, we construct an agent model that enables coordinated behavior by estimating human intention. We focus on collision avoidance as an example of a simple cooperative behavior. We implemented that a agent has Meta-Strategy model in a virtual environment. We have a collision avoidance experiment between virtual agent and human subject and analyzed subject's behavior. It was confirmed that the agent's behavior can influence the human avoidance behavior from experimental results.

Title: Representation of gaze, mood, and emotion: movie-watching with telepresence robots

Abstract: Two methods to enhance viewer's presence in movie-watching by telepresence robots in remote rooms are proposed. To keep coherance of eye-direction in all rooms, the system detects the object gazed by the viewer and controles the robot's face direction. To effectively express an affect change, which is tough to notice in non-face-to-face communication, the system interprets it into robot body action. These methods realize the suitable remote communication environment for movie-watching in remote places.

Title: A hierarchical structure for gesture recognition using RGB-D sensor

Abstract: Recently, gesture recognition using visual sensors has been paid increased attention as an intelligent technology for human-computer interaction. To achieve good recognition performance in vision-based gesture recognition, it is important to find an efficient representation of complex visual signals and a robust classification method that can deal with diverse variations of gesture data. To treat these challenging topics, we propose a hierarchical structure for feature extraction and measuring similarity between two gestures obtained through RGB-D video sensors such as Kinect. The efficiency of the proposed method is confirmed through computational experiments on a public benchmark database.

Title: Communicating emotions: a model for natural emotions in HRI

Abstract: Based on different psychological models of emotion, we argue that an intrapersonal account of emotion is not sufficient. Rather, we need interpersonal accounts of emotion that go beyond the assumption that a communicative agent simply displays her internal affective state and takes situational aspects into account. In this paper a computational model for the application of natural emotions in HRI is presented. Having a robot which is able to mimic emotional expressions and also use emotions in a strategic manner will enhance its emotional and social competence.

Title: Determining robot gaze according to participation roles in multiparty conversations

Abstract: Gaze is an important nonverbal feedback signal in multiparty face-to-face conversations. To build a robot that can convey the appropriate attentional behavior in human-robot multiparty conversations, this paper analyzes human attentional behaviors in multiparty conversations, and establishes gaze-transition models for speakers, addressees, and side participants. Further, the model was implemented in a humanoid robot that can control its gaze.

Title: Interactions on eyeballs of humanoid-robots

Abstract: There has previously been a plethora of research studies conducted on humanoid robots(especially "Androids" the robots designed with photorealistic appearances to look and act like a real human). However, these studies have still not found a solution to creating robot facial expressions, and the sense of discomfort created from interaction with a human and a robot without facial expressions or abnormal facial expressions.In this study, we focused on the gaze expressions of humanoid robots' eyes.We hypothesized that by constructing a more adequate interaction between the [visual object - eyeballs - head], we can make the movements of a humanoid robots' gaze more natural and less discomforting, or give them more impressive expressiveness. In order to explore this hypothesis, we have created and tested "GAZEROID", an original humanoid robot.

Title: Video-based emotion identification using face alignment and support vector machines

Abstract: This abstract introduces an efficient method for identifying various facial expressions from image inputs. To recognize the emotions of the facial expressions, a number of facial feature points were extracted. The extracted feature points are then transformed to 49-dimensional feature vectors which are robust to scale and translational variations, and the facial emotions are recognized by a support vector machine (SVM). Based on the experimental results, SVM performance was obtained by 50.8% for 6 emotion classification, and 78.0% for 3 emotions.

Title: Social networking sites photos and robots: a pilot research on facebook photo albums and robotics interfaces for older adults

Abstract: Human Computer/Robot Interaction has concerned about developing agents and tools for an effective performance in a user interaction scenario. In particular, the study on the usage of social media tools by older adults has been of a core theme to investigate. In this study, the interaction with a social network site tool, Facebook photo albums, supported by an agent embedded in an assistant robot is analyzed. Therefore, we present a study that explores the relationship between the type of interaction with the social network tool, and the level of perceived usefulness, ease of use, ease of learning and satisfaction by the elderly as users. The study found that the type of interface interaction with the social media tool affect the perception of the older adults in usefulness, ease of use, ease of learning and satisfaction: the older adults perceived the Facebook photo albums tool more useful, easy to use, easy to learn and felt more satisfied during the interaction with the robotic interface supported by the agent. Based on the results of this work, we can approach toward the integration of social network sites technologies for older adults and robots, not only for interaction design considerations, but also to help the seniors to overcome technological and social isolation.

Title: Telepresence robot that exaggerates non-verbal cues for taking turns in multi-party teleconferences

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a telepresence robot that exaggerates non-verbal cues for taking turns in multi- party teleconferences. In multi-party teleconferences, it is more difficult that the remote participants to take their turns than face-to-face. Therefore, it is assumed that the remote participants' turns are tended to decrease. It is said that addressee tends to be next speaker. Therefore, becoming addressee is previous step to become speaker and take turns. In order to make remote participant become addressee, proposed system recognized remote participant's non-verbal cues such as attention directions, nod motions and back- channels. Then, the system exaggerates the cues and expresses them as the telepresence robot's motions.

Title: Design everything by yourself

Abstract: We live in a mass-production society today and everyone buy and use same things all over the world. This is cheap, but not necessarily ideal for individual persons. We envision that computer tools that help people to design things by themselves can enrich their lives. To that end, we have developed innovative interaction techniques for end users to (1) create rich graphics such as three-dimensional models and animations by simple sketching (2) design their own real-world, everyday objects such as clothing and furniture with realtime physical simulation integrated in a simple geometry editor, and (3) design the behavior of their personal robots and give instructions to them to satisfy their particular needs. I will introduce these result with live demonstrations.

Title: Creative design computing for happy healthy living

Abstract: The age of ubiquitous/pervasive/ambient computing is upon us. We see more and more connected objects and devices embedded in everyday life. Design and Human-Computer Interaction are crucial components of information technologies that color our experience. As designers and technologists, we have the unique opportunity to imagine, design and create interesting, intelligent and interactive technologies for a smart living environment. A smart living environment is responsive, reconfigurable and transformable, embedded with sensors and actuators, to support everyday happy, healthy living with things that think, spaces that sense and places that play. Specifically, we see opportunity for investigating creative design computing to consider the built environment as an interface. We aim to engage people in playful, creative ways in which computing technologies embedded in the built environment (e.g., objects, furniture, building, and space) can support everyday happy healthy living. We build wellness technologies in different scales (e.g., in human-centered view: hand, body and environment), for various applications (e.g., to support emotional, physical, and intellectual wellness) to unlock human potential and augmenting human capabilities through digital design innovations. Opportunities exist for integrating multidisciplinary perspectives together to create innovation with impacts. For example, the Mobile Music Touch, a light-weight fingerless instrumented glove provides passive haptic learning of piano playing but also works as an effective rehabilitation tool. The ClockMe system, not only converts traditional pencil-and-paper Clock Drawing Test on a digital tablet for automatic scoring and analysis for detection of Alzheimer's disease and related disorders but also provides more information of the drawing behavior such as drawing sequence and pressure. The Digital Box and Block Test employs image processing to automatically detect and record a clinically validated post-stroke rehabilitation assessment for in-home use and a tangible gaming system to increase patient motivation. The Dodo game provides pictures of cute animals for color matching, and serves as a clinical screening test to detect color deficiency in young children. The Taste + bottle and spoon provide stimulation to alter the sense of taste without any chemical flavoring using electric pluses and color LED lights. It could encourage water drinking or enhance taste for people with restrictive diets or diminished taste sensations. The Sensorendipity is a real-time smartphone-based web-enabled sensor platform for designers to create sensor-based applications such as monitoring activities, in exergaming or safe driving. Now is an exciting time to engage in creative design computing, to implement physically and computationally enhanced environment, to explore experience media, to build prototypes, towards a smart living environment. Advancing technology offers new ways to solve problems, discover opportunities, and create new objects and experience that delight our senses and improve the way we live and work. Let's begin with the spark of creativity and enthusiasm and follow up with design and computational thinking towards the goal of creating unique technology for everyone.

Title: Crowdsourcing agents for smart IoT

Abstract: Activity recognition is a key capability for a smart environment to offer timely services and intelligent interactions with people, especially with the growing number of connected devices. While logging data from connected sensors is no longer beyond reach, it is still quite difficult to collect the labels required by machine learning approaches to activity recognition. In this research, crowdsourcing agents are designed to acquire status labels from people situated in the environment. Experiments on crowdsourcing in a typical building on campus have been conducted to improve air conditioning and space utilization. In particular, we will discuss how crowdsourcing agents in the form of simple physical objects can significantly improve user engagement as well as data quality. Collaboration among cyber-physical agents can lead to better user experience and overall performance.

Title: AS 2014: workshop on augmented sociality and interactive technology

Abstract: Researchers have developed computer systems which interact with people by recognizing situations around people. On the other hand, people behave socially based on perceived relations with others, being aware of a gaze from others, public pressure from others, and so on. If the computer systems can recognize the social relation and manage/control it, a new interactive service will emerge by enhancing the social skill of people. Designing, visualizing, and simulating relations also prepare a new socially interactive environment for people. The workshop named "Augmented Sociality and Interactive Technology" discuss the technologies which can deal with social relations and augment the social behaviors of people. Moreover, the workshop discuss interactive services using the technologies of the augmented sociality.

Title: Emotional scene understanding based on acoustic signals using adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system

Abstract: We propose a novel approach to recognize positive or negative emotions from acoustic signals in movies by extracting musical components such as tempo, loudness and melody and then by applying ANFIS Model with fuzzy clustering. In order to extract emotional features in acoustic signals, we first transform the sound into a spectrogram. The spectrogram visually represents characteristic information of sound such as tempo, loudness and melody. Then, we apply the fuzzy model on spectrogram to get the effective emotion features of sound. The extracted tempo, loudness and melody information is used as inputs for an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) with fuzzy c-means clustering (FCM). Finally, the ANFIS classifies the sound as positive or negative emotion, which is compared with a mean opinion score of human in test movies.

Title: CID 2014: workshop on cognitive interaction design

Abstract: Mutual adaptation plays an important role when people build a relation with the others and communicate with them. We can observe the adaptations not only in human-human communication but also in human-animal communication. For example, a service dog learns proper behaviors while reading the verbal and nonverbal expressions of a human. Also, the human behaves in response to what the dog learns. The workshop named "Cognitive Interaction Design" discusses the nature of the mutual adaptation between people or between a person and an animal. Moreover, it discusses the area of a field where the design of using the mutual adaptation for an interactive system shows exceptional performances.

Title: Design and Evaluation of an "Around the SmartPhone" Technique for 3D Manipulations on Distant Display

Abstract: In this paper, we present the "Around the SmartPhone" interaction technique for manipulating 3D elements displayed on a distant screen. The design of the technique is based on the selection of the most appropriate value for characteristics useful to discriminate existing tactile and tangible techniques for 3D manipulations. We perform two user studies to compare this around-device technique for translating and rotating 3D objects, with two existing tangible and tactile solutions, in terms of performance and user's preference. The literature establishes that the tactile technique evaluated is the best tactile technique among the existing tactile techniques for 3D manipulation. Despite this result, our user study reveals that the two others perform significantly better. In addition, when feedback visibility is preserved, the around-device technique offers similar performance results than the tangible one. Finally, the around-device technique is significantly preferred over the two others in every condition.

Title: Comparison of Device-Based, One and Two-Handed 7DOF Manipulation Techniques

Abstract: We evaluate three bimanual 7 degree-of-freedom (7DOF) object manipulation techniques that use a pair of precision grasped isotonic devices called buttonballs. 7DOF manipulation means changing position, orientation and scale. We compare the techniques in a (stereo) Fish-tank Virtual Reality (VR) system. The user study displays multiple randomly located boxes of different sizes and the user must dock (i.e. align) each target box with an objective box at the screen center. Comparing task completion times shows that in cases where target and objective boxes are the same size, all three techniques perform equivalently. When the sizes differ--requiring a scale change--two of the technique's, Spindle+Wheel and a minor variant of Grab-and-Scale perform similarly, and are both faster than the third technique, One-Hand+Scale. We compare and contrast our results with other work including free-hand versus held device input and also with 7DOF object manipulation versus 7DOF view manipulation.

Title: Creature Teacher: A Performance-Based Animation System for Creating Cyclic Movements

Abstract: We present Creature Teacher, a performance-based animation system for creating cyclic movements. Users directly manipulate body parts of a virtual character by using their hands. Creature Teacher's generic approach makes it possible to animate rigged 3D models with nearly arbitrary topology (e.g., non-humanoid) without requiring specialized user-to-character mappings or predefined movements. We use a bimanual interaction paradigm, allowing users to select parts of the model with one hand and manipulate them with the other hand. Cyclic movements of body parts during manipulation are detected and repeatedly played back - also while animating other body parts. Our approach of taking cyclic movements as an input makes mode switching between recording and playback obsolete and allows for fast and seamless creation of animations. We show that novice users with no animation background were able to create expressive cyclic animations for initially static virtual 3D creatures.

Title: Upper Body Leaning can affect Forward Self-Motion Perception in Virtual Environments

Abstract: The study of locomotion in virtual environments is a diverse and rewarding research area. Yet, creating effective and intuitive locomotion techniques is challenging, especially when users cannot move around freely. While using handheld input devices for navigation may often be good enough, it does not match our natural experience of motion in the real world. Frequently, there are strong arguments for supporting body-centered self-motion cues as they may improve orientation and spatial judgments, and reduce motion sickness. Yet, how these cues can be introduced while the user is not moving around physically is not well understood. Actuated solutions such as motion platforms can be an option, but they are expensive and difficult to maintain. Alternatively, within this article we focus on the effect of upper-body tilt while users are seated, as previous work has indicated positive effects on self-motion perception. We report on two studies that investigated the effects of static and dynamic upper body leaning on perceived distances traveled and self-motion perception (vection). Static leaning (i.e., keeping a constant forward torso inclination) had a positive effect on self-motion, while dynamic torso leaning showed mixed results. We discuss these results and identify further steps necessary to design improved embodied locomotion control techniques that do not require actuated motion platforms.

Title: Evaluating Mid-air List Interaction for Spatial Audio Interfaces

Abstract: Selecting items from lists is a common task in many applications. For wearable devices where no display is available, list selection can be challenging. To explore potential solutions we present four user studies evaluating mid-air gestures to interact with lists in an eyes-free interface. We found that a spatialized audio list in the shape of a 110~degree arc angled towards the dominant hand was a comfortable and usable layout for most users. A selection takes less than 10.6 seconds on average and error rates are below 4% when users locate and select an item in an unknown, unordered list of 20 items. For lists of 10 items the mean selection time is 5.5 seconds or less, and error rates drop below 1.4%. We compared monophonic to binaural playback of feedback sounds (musicons) and found no statistical difference for task completion times or error rates between the conditions. We also implemented and evaluated a music player application to showcase spatial audio list selection in an applied scenario.

Title: GyroWand: IMU-based Raycasting for Augmented Reality Head-Mounted Displays

Abstract: We present GyroWand, a raycasting technique for 3D interactions in self-contained augmented reality (AR) head-mounted displays. Unlike traditional raycasting which requires absolute spatial and rotational tracking of a user's hand or controller to direct the ray, GyroWand relies on the relative rotation values captured by an inertial measurement unit (IMU) on a handheld controller. These values cannot be directly mapped to the ray direction due to the phenomenon of sensor drift and the mismatch between the orientations of the physical controller and the virtual content. To address these challenges GyroWand 1) interprets the relative rotational values using a state machine which includes an anchor, an active, an out-of-sight and a disambiguation state; 2) handles drift by resetting the default rotation when the user moves between the anchor and active states; 3) does not initiate raycasting from the user's hand, but rather from other spatial coordinates (e.g. chin, shoulder, or chest); and 4) provides three new disambiguation mechanisms: Lock&Twist, Lock&Drag, and AutoTwist. In a series of controlled user studies we evaluated the performance and convenience of different GyroWand design parameters. Results show that a ray originating from the user's chin facilitates selection. Results also show that Lock&Twist is faster and more accurate than other disambiguation mechanisms. We conclude with a summary of the lessons learned for the adoption of raycasting in mobile augmented reality head-mounted displays.

Title: Combining Direct and Indirect Touch Input for Interactive Workspaces using Gaze Input

Abstract: Interactive workspaces combine horizontal and vertical touch surfaces into a single digital workspace. During an exploration of these systems, it was shown that direct interaction on the vertical surface is cumbersome and more inaccurate than on the horizontal one. To overcome these problems, indirect touch systems turn the horizontal touch surface into the input which allows manipulation of objects on the vertical display. If the horizontal touch surface also acts as a display, however, it becomes necessary to notify the system which screen is currently in use by providing a switching mode. We investigate the use of gaze tracking to perform these mode switches. In three user studies, we compare absolute and relative gaze augmented selection techniques with the traditional direct-touch approach. Our results show that our relative gaze augmented selection technique outperforms the other techniques for simple tapping tasks alternating between horizontal and vertical surfaces, and for dragging on the vertical surface. However, when tasks involve dragging across surfaces, the findings are more complex. We provide a detailed description of the proposed interaction techniques, a statistical analysis of these interaction techniques, and how they can be applied to systems that involve a combination of multiple horizontal and vertical touch surfaces.

Title: : Improvising Spatial Dialogues with an Artificially Intelligent Agent

Abstract: This paper presents an experimental framework for a virtual reality artwork, Duet, that employs a combination of live, full body motion capture and Oculus Rift HMD to construct an experience through which a human User can spatially interact with an artificially intelligent Agent. The project explores conceptual notions of embodied knowledge transfer, shared poetics of movement and distortions of the body schema. Within this context, both the User and the Agent become performers, constructing an intimate and spontaneously generated proximal space. The project generates a visualization of the relationship between the User and the Agent without the context of a fixed VR landscape or architecture. The Agent's ability to retain and accumulate movement knowledge in a way that mimics human learning transforms an interactive experience into a collaborative one. The virtual representation of both performers is distorted and amplified in a dynamic manner, enhancing the potential for creative dialogue between the Agent and the User.

Title: BlowClick: A Non-Verbal Vocal Input Metaphor for Clicking

Abstract: In contrast to the wide-spread use of 6-DOF pointing devices, free-hand user interfaces in Immersive Virtual Environments (IVE) are non-intrusive. However, for gesture interfaces, the definition of trigger signals is challenging. The use of mechanical devices, dedicated trigger gestures, or speech recognition are often used options, but each comes with its own drawbacks. In this paper, we present an alternative approach, which allows to precisely trigger events with a low latency using microphone input. In contrast to speech recognition, the user only blows into the microphone. The audio signature of such blow events can be recognized quickly and precisely. The results of an user study show that the proposed method allows to successfully complete a standard selection task and performs better than expected against a standard interaction device, the Flystick.

Title: Spatial Constancy of Surface-Embedded Layouts across Multiple Environments

Abstract: We introduce a layout manager that exploits the robust sensing capabilities of next-generation head-worn displays by embedding virtual application windows in the user's surroundings. With the aim of allowing users to find applications quickly, our approach leverages spatial memory of a known body-centric configuration. The layout manager balances multiple constraints to keep layouts consistent across environments while observing geometric and visual features specific to each locale. We compare various constraint weighting schemas and discuss outcomes of this approach applied to models of two test environments.

Title: Attracting User's Attention in Spherical Image by Angular Shift of Virtual Camera Direction

Abstract: A spherical image can contain the whole information of the landscape, allowing users to look at the point they want to. However, most of the information in a spherical image is often unimportant to the photographer, and only several points in the image are important. If users can view the spherical image completely freely, they may be unable to determine what the photographer thinks is important, and may stop viewing it before they notice the important points in the image. Therefore, a methodology to induce users to look at a selected point in the spherical image while leaving the interactiveness that allows them to look around with their intention is needed. In this paper, we propose a method to induce users to look at a selected point in the spherical image by using an angular shift in the direction of the virtual camera. We introduce a method of a tablet application called "Window to the Past," which was set up as a real exhibition. After analyzing a massive amount of user data obtained from the application, we found that our method worked well for spherical image viewing. The total amount of time during which users looked at selected points was significantly lengthened without feeling interrupted. The result also suggests that the induction method is also effective to make aware of users of virtual buttons on the image.

Title: Evaluation of Docking Task Performance Using Mid-air Interaction Techniques

Abstract: Mid-air interaction has the potential to manipulate objects in 3D with more natural input mappings. We compared the performance attainable using various mid-air interaction methods with a mechanically constrained input device in a 6 degrees-of-freedom (DoF) docking task in both accuracy and completion time. We found that tangible mid-air input devices supported faster docking performance, while exhibiting accuracy close to that of constrained devices. Interaction with bare hands in mid-air achieved similar time performance and accuracy compared to the constrained device.

Title: Models for Rested Touchless Gestural Interaction

Abstract: Touchless mid-air gestural interaction has gained mainstream attention with the emergence of off-the-shelf commodity devices such as the Leap Motion and the Xbox Kinect. One of the issues with this form of interaction is fatigue, a problem colloquially known as the ``Gorilla Arm Syndrome.' However, by allowing interaction from a rested position, whereby the elbow is rested on a surface, this problem can be limited in its effect. In this paper we evaluate 3 possible methods for performing touchless mid-air gestural interaction from a rested position: a basic rested interaction, a simple calibrated interaction which models palm positions onto a hyperplane, and a more complex calibration which models the arm's interaction space using the angles of the forearm as input. The results of this work found that the two modeled interactions conform to Fitts's law and also demonstrated that implementing a simple model can improve interaction by improving performance and accuracy.

Title: A Study on Proximity-based Hand Input for One-handed Mobile Interaction

Abstract: On-body user interfaces utilize the human's skin for both sensing input and displaying graphical output. In this paper, we present how the degree of freedom offered by the elbow joint, i.e., flexion and extension, can be leveraged to extend the input space of projective user interfaces. The user can move his hand towards or away from himself to browse through a multi-layer information space. We conducted a controlled experiment to investigate how accurately and efficiently users can interact in the space. The results revealed that the accuracy and efficiency of proximity-based interactions mainly depend on the traveling distance to the target layer while neither the hand side nor the direction of interaction have a significant influence. Based on our findings, we propose guidelines for designing on-body user interfaces.

Title: Comparing Direct Off-Screen Pointing, Peephole, and Flick & Pinch Interaction for Map Navigation

Abstract: Navigating large workspaces with mobile devices often require users to access information that spatially lies beyond it's viewport. To browse information on such workspaces, two prominent spatially-aware navigation techniques, peephole, and direct off-screen pointing, have been proposed as alternatives to the standard on-screen flick and pinch gestures. Previous studies have shown that both techniques can outperform on-screen gestures in various user tasks, but no prior study has compared the three techniques in a map-based analytic task. In this paper, we examine these two spatially-aware techniques and compare their efficiency to on-screen gestures in a map navigation and exploration scenario. Our study demonstrates that peephole and direct off-screen pointing allows for 30% faster navigation times between workspace locations and that on-screen flick and pinch is superior for accurate retrieval of workspace content.

Title: NaviChair: Evaluating an Embodied Interface Using a Pointing Task to Navigate Virtual Reality

Abstract: This research aims to investigate if using a more embodied interface that includes motion cueing can facilitate spatial updating compared to a more traditional non-embodied interface. The ultimate goal is to create a simple, elegant, and effective self-motion control interface. Using a pointing task, we quantify spatial updating in terms of mean pointing error to determine how two modes of locomotion compare: user powered motion cueing (use your body to swivel and tilt a joystick-like interface) and no-motion cueing (traditional joystick). Because the user-powered chair is a more embodied interface providing some minimal motion cueing, we hypothesized it should more effectively support spatial updating and, thus, increase task performance. Results showed, however, the user-powered chair did not significantly improve mean pointing performance in a virtual spatial orientation task (i.e., knowing where users are looking in the VE). Exit interviews revealed the control mechanism for the user-powered chair was not as accurate or easy to use as the joystick, although many felt more immersed. We discuss how user feedback can guide the design of more effective user-powered motion cueing to overcome usability issues and realize benefits of motion cueing.

Title: TRANSFORM: Beyond Tangible Bits, Towards Radical Atoms

Abstract: Whereas today's mainstream Human Computer Interaction (HCI) research addresses functional concerns - the needs of users, practical applications, and usability evaluation - Tangible Bits and Radical Atoms are driven by vision. This is because today's technologies will become obsolete in one year, and today's applications will be replaced in 10 years, but true visions, we believe, can last longer than 100 years. Tangible Bits seeks to realize seamless interfaces between humans, digital information, and the physical environment by giving physical form to digital information, making bits directly manipulable and perceptible. Our goal is to invent new design media, taking advantage of the richness of human senses and skills as developed through our lifetime of interaction with the physical world as well as the computational reflection enabled by real-time sensing and digital feedback. Radical Atoms takes a leap beyond Tangible Bits by assuming a hypothetical generation of materials that can change form and properties dynamically and computationally, becoming as reconfigurable as pixels on a screen. Radical Atoms is the future material that can transform its shape, conform to constraints, and inform the users of their affordances. Radical Atoms is a vision for the future of human-material interaction, in which all digital information has a tangible manifestation for interactions. I present the trajectory of our vision-driven design research from Tangible Bits towards Radical Atoms, and a variety of design projects presented and exhibited in arts, design, and science communities in the past 20 years.

Title: Oncall Piano Sensei: Portable AR Piano Training System

Abstract: We propose a portable AR piano training system that helps the user to learn piano with affordable cost and no space limitations. The optical music recognition (OMR) process is first applied so the system can automatically play the melody of a given sheet music. During the performance, the training system indicates which note is playing and which corresponding piano key should be pressed on the keyboard. Our system also detects which keys are pressed by the user and give sound/visual feed-back to correct the user. With no requirement of a physical piano and tutor, our system extends a great range of time and space for the user who wants to learn piano.

Title: HaptoClone (Haptic-Optical Clone): Mid-air Haptic-Optical Human-Human Interaction with Perfect Synchronization

Abstract: In this research, we propose a new interactive system that can display haptic and optical clone image in mid-air. We named our system "HaptoClone". Fig. 1 (a) shows how our system works. Our system provides following new experiences. 1) The people facing our system are optically copied to the other side without any time delay by using the Aerial Imaging Plates. 2) A user can see both their own hand and the other's cloned body in the same coordinate. The position and the timing of the clone image is perfectly synchronized to original motion. 3) Tactile feedback can be given when they virtually touch each other. The tactile feedback is given in mid-air by using a phase-controlled ultrasound array. Our system enables users to communicate with each other through haptics in real time with optical clone image.

Abstract: We have been working on "twirling" interfaces, featuring affordances spun in "padiddle" or "poi" style. The affordances, crafted out of mobile devices (smartphones and tablets) embedded into twirlable toys, sense their orientation and allow "mobile-ambient" individual control of public display, such as a large format screen. Typically one or two users will face such graphical display and twirl their manipulables, whilst a representation of them and their respective toys are projected into a fantasy scene. The projected scene is rendered egocentrically by centering the projection on the avatars as a virtual camera orbits around in an arcing, spin-around "inspection gesture." Besides dorsal, "tethered" viewing perspectives, the projection is intended for frontal, "mirror" perspectives as well and also intermediate camera angles. The fantasy scene is not a totally faithful mapping of the real-life "meatspace" scene, since both avatar handedness and affordance phase are adjusted to flatter frontal views and other camera angles. Environmental lighting is deployed in the user space as a token indicating the relative position of the virtual camera in the fantasy scene relative to the self-identified avatars. Awareness of virtual camera position and presumed perspective of human users causes supernatural ambidextrous hand-switching and continuous, deliberate distortion of affordance azimuth, parameterized by unwrapped phase of orbiting camera. But even with the environmental lighting as an indication of subjective viewpoint, such projection can be difficult for users to understand, so we developed an alternate view on the scene. To clarify the reality distortion, a 1st-order scene display of the pre-warped user space is hereby introduced, logically interpolating between the 0-order user space and the 2nd-order fantasy scene, featuring an exocentric perspective with basically fixed camera position (except for allowing interocular displacement to accommodate stereoscopic views). We use Alice (v. 3) for both the 1st- and 2nd-order renderings, associated by mixed virtuality rigging with affordance-embedded mobile devices through some middleware. The 1st-order scene is more like a faithful rendering of the user space, stripped of the fantasy scene elements (setting, costume, props, etc.), but highlighting the virtual-camera-controlled avatar ambidexterity and affordance phase modulation with "ghost" appendages. It features simulation of the orbiting virtual camera, displaying its accumulated phase as a coil, making explicit the unresolved tension ("borrowed" but "unreturned") introduced by the orbit and manifesting as consequent phase perturbation of the projected affordance. Simulation of the environmental lighting is included as well, showing the quadrant-wise determination of the demultiplexed light as the virtual camera sweeps around. The phase coil is portrayed as a helix attached to the orbiting virtual camera, the better to appreciate its unwrapped phase. The height of the camera is fixed (and slightly pointing down) at the height of the avatar head. The idea of meta-scenes and explicit, objective ``full citizen' cameras within scenes is not new. It has been used, for instance, in movie blocking simulations and visualization of computer graphic projections. The research described here applies such ideas to to mixed virtuality environments with fluid perspective. Our prototype is contextualized as a proof-of-concept of mobile-ambient interfaces, using personal devices to control public displays, and supported by the notions of hierarchies of perspective and subject-object relationships.

Title: TAMGeF: Touch-midAir-Motion Framework for Spatial Input

Abstract: TAMGeF, Touch-midAir-Motion Gesture Framework is a modern template-based, multi-threaded, C++ cross-platform framework for spatial input devices. In this paper, we provide a look at the lower-level layer of TAMGeF, which provides two contributions to the creation of framework development for input devices: Device generalization (or abstraction) and thread-safe Observer-Queue Pattern. We show that these two contributions provide a foundation for any input device framework.

Title: Modeling Mid-air Gestures With Spherical Coordinates

Abstract: Generally, touchless mid-air gestural interaction use some form of Cartesian coordinate system within the input space. Most implementations map the input space in 3-D and map it to the 2-D of the monitor for output. In our previous work we showed that modeling the interaction space produces better interaction [1]. In this study, we use the Myo armband to show that a modeled interaction space also benefits devices that use spherical coordinates.

Title: Transition Times for Manipulation Tasks in Hybrid Interfaces

Abstract: Previous work has shown that uninstrumented in-air interaction is slower and not as precise for pointing tasks compared to the mouse. Yet, there are interaction scenarios where it is preferable or advantageous to use in-air input. Therefore, we examine a three-device hybrid setup involving the mouse, keyboard, and a Leap Motion. We performed a user study to quantify the costs associated with transitioning between these interaction devices and also for performing simple 2D manipulation tasks using the mouse and Leap Motion. We discovered that transitioning to and from the Leap Motion takes on average 0.87 seconds longer than transitions between the mouse and keyboard.

Title: Gesture-based Sound Localization and Manipulation

Abstract: With current advancements in computer vision depth sensing technologies, gestures provide a new means of computer interaction. 3D audio research has gained significant ground in accurately localizing sound in 3D space, but not much work has been conducted relating to modes of user interaction in such applications. In this paper, gestures are used as a more natural way of interacting with 3D spatial audio applications, specifically for the localization and manipulation of sound sources.

Title: Making Static Figures Posable: An Interactive Figure Transformation System For Naive Users

Abstract: We propose a system which can fabricate articulated figures based on static ones. We first scan the static figure to obtain a digital 3D model. The user can then insert joints to this 3D model interactively with hand gestures. Our system will then adjust the position of the joints to match the surrounding geometry and carve the collided area during the rotation inspection process. With our system, a naive user can easily convert and print out a posable, articulated figure.

Title: OpenUIX Demo: A Sneak Peek at a Novel HCI Model for AR Systems

Abstract: As a result of our research work, we present a demo app that showcases the different interaction techniques that can be implemented using OpenUIX; a novel HCI model that provides the logical mechanisms to easily design Spatial User Interfaces. Thanks to this solution, interaction designers can define widget behaviors that not only take into consideration the physical surroundings of the end users, but also their general context (including their psychological state and any disability they might have). An approach that greatly facilitates the creation and sharing of user experiences adapted to the actual needs and desires of the users (therefore liberating designers from the responsibility of creating responsive and accessible versions of their user interfaces).

Title: Spatial Audio Feedback for Hand Gestures in Games

Abstract: We use game prototypes to investigate different audio feedback designs for hand gestures for encouraging immersion. Replacing explicit audio instructions for hand positions and movements with responsive audio feedback, suggestive of interaction methods by using environmental story-related audio cues, leads to measurably higher immersion. We present the design of responsive audio feedback for hand gestures in the context of such a game. The spatial organization of diegetic environmental feedback before, during, and after gesture input is supported by a structured approach towards the design of audio cues.

Title: Effects of Bezel Size in Large Tiled Display Gaming

Abstract: Many spatial UI systems (e.g., VR) rely on large displays. One method of building large high-resolution displays is to use multiple HD monitors as tiles in a single large display. The downside is the presence of monitor borders -- bezels -- between each tile in such a display. We present a study looking at the impact of bezel width on game playing on a large tiled display.

Title: Differences in Perspective and Software Scaling

Abstract: We present a study comparing differences in visual scale due to perspective (distance) and software scaling. The software scaling method corrected for quantization of the input device and resolution to ensure equivalency in the scaling methods. Results indicate that while perspective yields consistent performance across different scale factors, software scaling did not.

Title: Tough Shift: Exploring the Complexities of Shifting Residential Electricity Use Through a Casual Mobile Game

Abstract: Modern electrical grids are increasingly reliant on generation from renewable sources that can vary from hour to hour. This variability has led to the desire to shift the times of the day when electricity is consumed to better match generation. One way to achieve these shifts is by encouraging people to change their behavior at home. Leveraging prior research on encouraging reductions in residential energy use through game play, we introduce ShareBuddy: a casual mobile game intended to encourage players not only to reduce, but also to shift their electricity use. We conducted two field studies in a student dormitory and found that players did not shift their electricity use, because they were unwilling to change their schedules and found it easier to focus on reducing electricity use. Based on our findings, we discuss the implications for encouraging shifting, and also the challenges of integrating real-world resource use into a game.

Title: The Placebo Effect in Digital Games: Phantom Perception of Adaptive Artificial Intelligence

Abstract: Play-testing of digital games is a crucial part of any game development process, used to gather feedback about the game and correct any existing and potential flaws with the design. However, due to the nature of human subject testing, the feedback being collected in such experiments is prone to biases. Players' expectations play a great role in dictating their gaming experience, which means the information players receive before trying a new game, as well as the knowledge they already possess, may affect their perception and experience of the game. Two studies were conducted in order to evaluate how priming players to expect a game technology can positively influence their experience. The results supported the hypothesis that even basic instructions can change players' perception of the game, and lead to a higher level of perceived immersion when knowing that the game contains an improved feature, the adaptive artificial intelligence (AI), while it is not present in the game.

Title: Utilizing Gravity in Movement-Based Games and Play

Abstract: This paper seeks to expand the understanding of gravity as a powerful but underexplored design resource for movement-based games and play. We examine how gravity has been utilized and manipulated in digital, physical, and mixed reality games and sports, considering five central and gravity-related facets of user experience: realism, affect, challenge, movement diversity, and sociality. For each facet, we suggest new directions for expanding the field of movement-based games and play, for example through novel combinations of physical and digital elements.Our primary contribution is a structured articulation of a novel point of view for designing games and interactions for the moving body. Additionally, we point out new research directions, and our conceptual framework can be used as a design tool. We demonstrate this in 1) creating and evaluating a novel gravity-based game mechanic, and 2) analyzing an existing movement-based game and suggesting future improvements.

Title: How Self-Esteem Shapes our Interactions with Play Technologies

Abstract: The experience that results from video game play is shaped by the play environment, but also by various characteristics of the person playing. We investigated how player self-esteem predicts post-game motivation (enjoyment, effort, and tension), and conducted mediated regressions to show that players' self-esteem alters post-play motivation by affecting how needs are satisfied during play. We also explored how self-esteem predicts post-play positive and negative affect and conducted mediated regressions to show how motivation partially mediates those effects. Our work suggests that players with different levels of self-esteem experience games differently; but more importantly, we provide an explanation of how these differences form by examining the mechanisms during games that ultimately contribute to player experience. Situating our results within theories of self, we discuss the importance of self-esteem for understanding player experience, describe the implications for games research, and consider how self-esteem shapes our interactions with play technologies.

Title: Sequential Analysis of Player Behavior

Abstract: Understanding how interaction unfolds over time is a key factor for understanding the dynamics aspects of player behavior. Thus far, analysis of sequential patterns of player behavior has, however, mainly focused on discovering frequently recurring patterns. However, frequency of occurrence is not always a reliable indicator of a pattern's importance as infrequent patterns can also offer valuable insights about in-game behavior. In this paper we thus propose the use of lag sequential analysis (LSA) -- which, rather than relying on frequency counts, makes use of statistical methods to determine the significance of sequential transitions -- to aid analysis of behavioral streams of players. For this purpose we apply LSA to in-game data of two well-known games. The meaningfulness of the identified sequences is verified by comparing them to documented and established strategies. In addition, results obtained through LSA are discussed in relation to results from frequency-based sequence mining. Our results suggest that LSA is a promising complement to frequency based methods for analyzing sequential behavior patterns of players.

Title: Get off the Couch: An Approach to Utilize Sedentary Commercial Games as Exergames

Abstract: The objective of this research is evaluating a novel method to enable any sedentary commercial game to be utilized as an effective exercise game (exergame). In general there are significantly fewer exergames than sedentary games. This limits game choice and potentially has negative implications for long-term use. Previous work on exergames has been focused on deriving guidelines for designing the most effective exergames, but has rarely leveraged the mass amounts of existing sedentary games. To address this issue, we present a potentially generalizable approach to utilize sedentary commercial games as exergames. Specifically, we developed a visual overlay technique that interfaces with a Microsoft Kinect and disrupts the user's visual perception of a game as a consequence for lower exercise performance. To evaluate this approach, we conducted a two user studies with 14 and 20 undergraduate students that evaluated use in single-player and two-player competitive modes, respectively. Results indicate that although we expected intermittently blocking players' view would be annoying, it actually made the game more exciting, while at the same time providing a vigorous workout.

Title: What Drives People: Creating Engagement Profiles of Players from Game Log Data

Abstract: A central interest of game designers and game user researchers is to understand why players enjoy their games. While a number of researchers have explored player enjoyment in general, few have talked about methods for enabling designers to understand the players of their specific game. In this paper we explore the creation of engagement profiles of game players based on log data. These profiles take into account the different ways that players engage with the game and highlight patterns associated with active play. We demonstrate our approach by performing a descriptive analysis of the game Forza Motorsport 5 using data from a sample of 1.2 million users of the game and discuss the implications of our findings.

Title: Determining the Characteristics of Preferred Virtual Faces Using an Avatar Generator

Abstract: Video game developers continuously increase the degree of details and realism in games to create more human-like characters. But increasing the human-likeness becomes a problem in regard to the Uncanny Valley phenomenon that predicts negative feelings of people towards artificial entities. We developed an avatar creation system to examine preferences towards parametrized faces and explore in regard to the Uncanny Valley phenomenon how people design faces that they like or reject. Based on the 3D model of the Caucasian average face, 420 participants generate 1341 faces of positively and negatively associated concepts of both gender. The results show that some characteristics associated with the Uncanny Valley are used to create villains or repulsive faces. Heroic faces get attractive features but are rarely and little stylized. A voluntarily designed face is very similar to the heroine. This indicates that there is a tendency of users to design feminine and attractive but still credible faces.

Title: Higher Graphical Fidelity Decreases Players' Access to Aggressive Concepts in Violent Video Games

Abstract: Several features of violent video games (hence VVGs) may cause gamers to access aggressive concepts during play. Two of these features are graphical fidelity and use of narrative. In particular, the increased graphical fidelity of modern VVGs is widely theorised to cause increased access to aggressive concepts. However, despite this theoretical speculation, there is little empirical evidence of whether these formal features of VVGs actually do influence players to access aggressive concepts during play. Therefore, a 2x2 between-subjects factorial online experiment (N = 710) was employed. This examined the effects of graphical fidelity and narrative content on the extent to which players accessed aggression-related concepts when playing a VVG. Results indicated that the presence of realistic graphics in a video game representing aggression caused players to access aggressive concepts less (p = 0.014). The presence of narrative content was not found to have a statistically significant effect. Under an influential (though controversial) model of VVG effects known as the General Aggression Model, increased access to aggressive concepts causally contributes to anti-social behaviour by players of VVGs. These findings suggest that even if playing modern VVGs did lead to these negative effects, they would not be influenced by the increased graphical fidelity of modern VVGs.

Title: Exploring Gameplay Experiences on the Oculus Rift

Abstract: Compared to previous head-mounted displays, the compact and low-cost Oculus Rift has claimed to offer improved virtual reality experiences. However, how and what kinds of user experiences are encountered by people when using the Rift in actual gameplay has not been examined. We present an exploration of 10 participants' experiences of playing a first-person shooter game using the Rift. Despite cybersickness and a lack of control, participants experienced heightened experiences, a richer engagement with passive game elements, a higher degree of flow and a deeper immersion on the Rift than on a desktop setup. Overly demanding movements, such as the large range of head motion required to navigate the game environment were found to adversely affect gaming experiences. Based on these and other findings, we also present some insights for designing games for the Rift.

Title: Playing Alone, Playing With Others: Differences in Player Experience and Indicators of Wellbeing

Abstract: Video game play is becoming an increasingly social experience, yet we have little understanding of how social and solitary modes of play differ in terms of the player experience or interact with player wellbeing. An online survey (n = 446) collected data on players' current mode of play, their game play experience, social capital gained from game play and wellbeing. The results indicate that social and solitary players differ in terms of degree of autonomy, presence and relatedness experienced, while the different types of social play are associated with differences in relatedness and social capital experienced. Different predictors of wellbeing were also present across solitary and social player samples. People who play games on their own experience greater wellbeing when experiencing in-game autonomy. Social players experience greater wellbeing when playing with strangers, and when experiencing in-game bridging social capital. All players experienced increased wellbeing with age and decreased wellbeing with greater amounts of play.

Title: Removing the HUD: The Impact of Non-Diegetic Game Elements and Expertise on Player Involvement

Abstract: Previous research has shown that player involvement can be influenced by a range of factors, from the controllers used to the perceived level of challenge provided by the game. However, little attention has been paid to the influence of the game interface. Game interfaces consist of both diegetic (that can be viewed by the player-character, e.g. the game world) and non-diegetic components (that are only viewed by the player, e.g. the heads-up display). In this paper we examine two versions of a first-person shooter game to investigate how immersion is influenced through interacting with a diegetic and non-diegetic interface. Our findings suggest that the removal of non-diegetic elements, such as the heads-up display, is able to influence immersion in expert players through increasing their cognitive involvement and sense of control. We argue that these results illustrate the importance of considering the role of expertise in relation to how particular design choices will influence the player experience.

Title: Exploring Twitter as a Game Platform; Strategies and Opportunities for Microblogging-based Games

Abstract: Recent years have seen the massive daily engagement of players with games that are integrated with online social networking sites, such as Facebook. However, few games have successfully created engaging experiences through integration with microblogging websites. In this paper, we explore the opportunities and challenges in using Twitter as a platform for playing games, through the case study of the game Hashtag Dungeon, a dungeon-crawling game that uses Twitter for collaborative creation of game content. Two studies were carried out. A quantitative user study with 32 participants demonstrated that players found the game engaging and rewarding. A follow-up qualitative study with 8 participants suggests that Twitter integration in this game is meaningful, but that there are concerns over the impact of the game on players' Twitter profiles. Based on findings from both studies, we propose strategies for the design of Microblogging-based games, and discuss wider implications of social media integration in games.

Title: The Avatar Affordances Framework: Mapping Affordances and Design Trends in Character Creation Interfaces

Abstract: Avatar customization is available in many games, but as yet there is no analytical framework capable of enabling systematic comparison between games. To investigate this issue, we present our novel analytical framework, referred to as the Avatar Affordances Framework. To model the framework, we analyze the character creation interfaces of 20 games. We focus in particular on the different ways gender and ethnicity are presented to players. Preliminary analysis reveals that many popular games have socially exclusive values, and that high fidelity character creation interfaces are no exception. The framework itself offers a more comprehensive tool than previous (e.g., count-based) approaches to investigating self-representation issues in character creation interfaces.

Title: Designing for Exertion: How Heart-Rate Power-ups Increase Physical Activity in Exergames

Abstract: Exergames have proven to be a fun way of engaging in physical activity, but analyses of the energy expenditure required to play exergames indicate that most exergame play is not sufficiently vigorous to replace traditional physical activity. In this paper, we argue that it is important to design for exertion in exergames. To illustrate this idea, we present a novel game mechanic, the heart rate power-up, which can be applied to a wide range of exergame styles. A study of 20 participants found that heart-rate power-ups increase exertion levels in games -- sometimes dramatically -- while also increasing players' level of enjoyment.

Title: The Game Genre Map: A Revised Game Classification

Abstract: The existing common video game genres lack clarity as well as consistency and thus cannot serve as a solid reference to inform the research on digital educational games (DEG), which are increasingly used as learning tools. To address this basic issue of game classification, we have developed a web-based survey to collect data on how people play and perceive video games that they know well. The survey is grounded in our Game Elements-Attributes Model (GEAM). 321 valid responses were analysed using established hierarchical clustering methods and a novel mapping technique that computes the degree of relevance of individual game attributes to game types and visualises them with hues of grey. The game genre map so obtained can improve the existing game classification.

Title: PLEXQ: Towards a Playful Experiences Questionnaire

Abstract: Playfulness is an important, but often neglected, design quality for interactive products. This paper presents a first step towards a validated questionnaire called PLEXQ, which measures 17 different facets of playful user experiences. We describe the development and validation of the questionnaire, from the generation of 231 items, to the current questionnaire consisting of 17 constructs of playfulness, each measured through three items. Using PLEXQ we discuss the nature of playfulness by looking at the role of age, gender, and product type in one's proclivity to experience playfulness differently. Finally, we reveal a four-factor structure of playfulness and discuss the implications for further theory development.

Title: From Front-End to Back-End and Everything In-Between: Work Practice in Game Development

Abstract: This paper addresses a paucity in the literature of studies of actual game development. It presents the initial findings from a questionnaire addressed to game development companies together with an ethnographic case study that drills into how resources are actually used and how the workflow and coordination are actually accomplished. It finds a number of challenges that can be seen to confront the development of new game authoring tools, centred around the intensely co-present character of design-related interaction and collaboration in this domain. These findings are used to articulate a range of potential requirements.

Title: Peter the Fashionista?: Computer Programming Games and Gender Oriented Cultural Forms

Abstract: We present a study of two games designed to help elementary and middle school students learn computer programming concepts. The first game was intended to be "gender neutral", aligning with might be described as a consensus opinion on best practices for computational learning environments. The second game, based on the cultural form of dress up dolls was deliberately designed to appeal to girls. We recruited 70 participants in an international two-phase study to investigate the relationship between games, gender, attitudes towards computer programming, and learning. Our findings suggest that while the two games were equally effective in terms of learning outcomes, there were differences in motivation between players of the two games. Specifically, participants who reported a preference for girl-oriented games were more motivated to learn about computer programming when they played a game that they perceived as designed for girls. In addition, we describe how the two games seemed to encourage different types of social activity between players in a classroom setting. Based on these results we reflect on the strategy of exclusively designing games and activities as "gender neutral", and suggest that deliberately employing cultural forms, including gendered ones, may help create a more productive experience for learners

Title: Gaze-Based Onlooker Integration: Exploring the In-Between of Active Player and Passive Spectator in Co-Located Gaming

Abstract: In co-located gaming, a player is often watched by another person who has no direct interaction with the game. For such a potential onlooker, the game setting is mainly experienced with ones eyes by looking at what happens on the screen. An integration of an onlooker's gaze into the game could potentially improve the game experience of player and onlooker. In this paper we report a study based on an interaction concept that uses the gaze of a second observing person during a co-located gaming situation as an input modality to assist the player. Our study investigates the effects of different levels of gaze-based onlooker integration and their influence on the player's and the onlooker's experience. With our research we want to address the "in-between" design space of being an active player or a passive spectator. Our findings show that gaze-based onlooker integration can address this "in-between", and change the game experience for both player and onlooker for the better.

Title: Increasing Donating Behavior Through a Game for Change: The Role of Interactivity and Appreciation

Abstract: Games for change have attracted the interest of humanitarian aid organizations and researchers alike. However, their effectiveness to promote behavior such as donating remains unclear. Furthermore, little is known about how key game properties interactivity and presentation mode impact the effectiveness of these games, or how player attitudes and experiences relate to the interplay between game properties and donating behavior. In this study, experimental conditions were systematically varied in their interactivity and presentation mode. Thereby, 234 participants played, watched, or read through one of six variations of the narrative of the game Darfur is Dying. Following this, they were asked to choose the percentage of an unexpected bonus to donate to a charity. While interactivity increased donating by an average of 12%, presentation mode had no significant impact on the percentage donated. Thus, between presentation mode and interactivity, interactivity was found to be the more impactful game property. Moreover, appreciation fully mediated the relationship between interactivity and donating, hinting at its relevance for the evaluation of the effectiveness of games for change.

Title: Using Empirical Learning Curve Analysis to Inform Design in an Educational Game

Abstract: Having insights into players' learning has important implications for design in an educational game. Empirical learning curve analysis is an approach from intelligent tutoring systems literature for measuring student learning within a system in terms of the skills involved. The approach can be used to evaluate how well different hypothesized models of required skills fit to actual student performance data from the game. This information can be used to highlight whether players need more practice with specific concepts, how the game's progression might be altered, and whether the game is succeeding at its educational objectives. In this paper we apply empirical learning curve analysis to Beanstalk, an educational game designed to teach young children the concept of balance. We show that the process is able to give insight into the detailed skills and concepts (or knowledge components) that players are learning, and give implications for level (re)design by highlighting a previously unforeseen shortcut strategy.

Title: Quantifying Individual Differences, Skill Development, and Fatigue Effects in Small-Scale Exertion Interfaces

Abstract: Game mechanics in sports video games for skills like running and throwing are nothing like those skills in real sports. Adding small-scale exertion to the control scheme -- using small muscle groups such as hands and fingers -- can re-introduce some degree of physicality into sports video games. However, there is little quantitative knowledge about how small-scale exertion affects individual variability, skill development, or fatigue -- and how it compares to traditional game mechanics. We carried out two studies to provide this quantitative information. Our studies showed that controlling movement with small-scale exertion was significantly and substantially different from rate-based control, and that both movement and passing skills showed significant increases with practice. Our work provides valuable information that can help designers decide when and how to use small-scale exertion, and provides an empirical basis for the design of new game interaction techniques.

Title: Game-based Assessment of Psycho-acoustic Thresholds: Not All Games Are Equal!

Abstract: This paper first presents a critical analysis of an existing game (APEX), designed by researchers in psychoacoustics only, to measure psychoacoustic thresholds in preschoolers. Next it presents another game (DIESEL-X), designed by dyslexia researchers and game designers, to remediate the shortcomings of the former game. Via a repeated measures experiment (n = 95), the game experience, attention, and psychoacoustic thresholds are compared. It is shown that the children prefer the game experience of DIESEL-X over APEX. Moreover, the former game was able to measure lower frequency-modulation thresholds than APEX. These results demonstrate that when it comes down to game-based assessment of children's perceptual capabilities, the quality of game design not only has an effect on game experience, but equally on the scientific measurements obtained via such a game-based assessment.

Title: Integrated Questionnaires: Maintaining Presence in Game Environments for Self-Reported Data Acquisition

Abstract: Research in human-computer interaction often requires the acquisition of self-reported data. Particularly concerning serious games, the interaction between the game and the user still holds many unknown aspects, partly due to the user's double role as player and learner. An easy way of collecting data consists of questionnaires, mostly employed in pen-and-paper or electronic form. In order to gather data points during game play, the player is interrupted, potentially causing unintentional side effects. We suggest an integration of questionnaires into games as game elements, in order to mitigate the effects of interruption. A serious game prototype with an integrated survey was implemented, and evaluated regarding its effects on the players' experience of presence.

Title: An Optical Brain Imaging Study on the Improvements in Mathematical Fluency from Game-based Learning

Abstract: In this study we examined the effectiveness of game-based learning in improving math fluency compared to a conventional drill and practice approach. An optical brain imaging method called functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIR) was utilized to assess changes in brain activation in prefrontal cortex related to cognitive load and working memory functions, so that the improvement gained by the increased attentional and cognitive training involved in a mobile game called MathDash could be examined in terms of how and why game-based learning can be effective. Overall, our experiment with college students indicated that Math Dash was equally effective in terms of improving computational fluency in comparison to the drill and practice approach.

Title: Player-Computer Interaction Features for Designing Digital Play Experiences across Six Degrees of Water Contact

Abstract: Physical games involving the use of water or that are played in a water environment can be found in many cultures throughout history. However, these experiences have yet to see much benefit from advancements in digital technology. With advances in interactive technology that is waterproof, we see a great potential for digital water play. This paper provides a guide for commencing projects that aim to design and develop digital water-play experiences. A series of interaction features are provided as a result of reflecting on prior work as well as our own practice in designing playful experiences for water environments. These features are examined in terms of the effect that water has on them in relation to a taxonomy of six degrees of water contact, ranging from the player being in the vicinity of water to them being completely underwater. The intent of this paper is to prompt forward thinking in the prototype design phase of digital water-play experiences, allowing designers to learn and gain inspiration from similar past projects before development begins.

Title: Operation Citadel: Exploring the Role of Docents in Mixed Reality

Abstract: In this paper we describe the role of docents in a mixed reality game at a historic site called Operation: Citadel. The docents act as intermediaries between the system and the participants, providing interpretation and understanding of the game and managing interaction. This permits the integration of sophisticated interactions and rich narrative while maintaining the walk-up-and-use, casual nature of the exhibit. We describe the implementation and design, and examine the effect that docents had on enjoyment of and frustration with the game. Our results indicate that docents can serve an important role in augmenting participant experience. We identify and describe a set of roles unique to docents of Mixed Reality experiences.

Title: Anticipatory Gaze Shifts during Navigation in a Naturalistic Virtual Environment

Abstract: In the real world, coupled eye and head movements are used by humans and other animals to orient their gaze toward objects or scenes of interest. In virtual environments a mouse is often used as a proxy for head movements, orienting the camera towards a desired view direction. The mouse also controls body direction during navigation, orienting the user's avatar to a desired movement direction. The interaction between gaze and mouse actions in realistic virtual environments has received only limited study. Using a desktop eye tracker, we recorded the participants while they explored a virtual tropical island for ten minutes. We found evidence for anticipatory gaze shifts prior to mouse movement. The results suggest that despite the loss of eye-head coupling, gaze behavior in virtual environments resembles that of real life.

Title: Gaze-Supported Gaming: MAGIC Techniques for First Person Shooters

Abstract: MAGIC--Manual And Gaze Input Cascaded-pointing techniques have been proposed as an efficient way in which the eyes can support the mouse input in pointing tasks. MAGIC Sense is one of such techniques in which the cursor speed is modulated by how far it is from the gaze point. In this work, we implemented a continuous and a discrete adaptations of MAGIC Sense for First-Person Shooter input. We evaluated the performance of these techniques in an experiment with 15 participants and found no significant gain in performance, but moderate user preference for the discrete technique.

Title: Manipulating Leaderboards to Induce Player Experience

Abstract: Assessing and inducing player experience (pX) in games user research (GUR) is complicated because of the tradeoff between maintaining rigour through experimental control and having participants feel like they are engaged in play. To establish and evaluate an embedded method for inducing a sense of success or failure in participants during gameplay (e.g., to study how different players exhibit resilience to in-game failure), we manipulated leaderboard position in an experiment in which 155 participants played a Bejeweled clone. We show that manipulating success perception through leaderboards increases the player's perception of competence, autonomy, presence, enjoyment, and positive affect over manipulated failure. In addition, displaying the score enhances the effect on positive affect, autonomy and enjoyment, while not increasing detectability.

Title: Expressing Emotions With Synthetic Affect Bursts

Abstract: In this paper we introduce the idea of anthropomorphic auditory icons, which are synthetic affect bursts that can be used in entertainment scenarios and other interactive systems to display emotional states of game characters, animated animals, robots or other anthropomorphic objects. We describe a novel method to construct this type of auditory icons, which basically involves the principle of vocoding on existing recordings of human affect bursts as modulating sounds and arbitrary synthetic sounds as carriers. In this way we are able to use a single custom sound to generate a set of synthetic affect bursts with similar sound characteristics as the original sound sample. We further present findings of a first user study exploring the recognition efficiency of emotions in synthetic affect bursts created with this method.

Title: "After All the Time I Put Into This": Co-Creation and the End-of-life of Social Network Games

Abstract: User engagement in processes of co-design and co-creation are common practices in Social Network Games (SNGs). Though the interdependency between producer and user is of mutual benefit throughout much of the lifetime of an SNG, there are critical moments where this relationship becomes problematic. We adopt an ethnographic approach, covering the entire three year lifespan of a well-known SNG, with a focus on the 'end of life' experience from players' perspectives. Our results show that, at the game's discontinuation announcement, players reflect strongly on the value that they associate with their gameplay and its involvement. We suggest that the notion of players as co-creators may be undervalued by companies during strategic decision-making especially since at discontinuation players are left without ownership of their co-created product. This deeper understanding of players as co-creators serves as case study for developers building social games both on and off social networking platforms.

Title: Hide and Seek: Exploring Interaction With Smart Wallpaper

Abstract: Displays are getting larger, thinner, and are consuming less power. The logical conclusion of this trend is a future in which wall-size displays are common in homes, a concept we have described as "smart wallpaper" for the purposes of evaluating its HCI implications. What new kinds of experience could smart wallpaper provide? This paper describes a case study on one potential smart wallpaper experience: an interactive children's game. Our results suggest that children and their families see substantial value in both the game and the concept of smart wallpaper. They valued the immersion, the physical activity and the shared nature of the experience. On the basis of this study, we conclude that there is substantial potential for wall-size displays to enable valuable experiences for children and their families, and that smartphones can be used as an intuitive means of interacting with them.

Title: Adaptation in Digital Games: The Effect of Challenge Adjustment on Player Performance and Experience

Abstract: Good gaming experiences hinge on players being able to have a balance between challenge and skill. However, achieving that balance is challenging, so dynamic difficulty adjustment offers the opportunity to provide better gaming experiences through adapting the challenge in the game to suit an individual's capabilities. The risk though is that in adapting the difficulty, players do not get a true sense of challenge, but rather some tailored, perhaps watered down experience. In this note, we report on a study, in which we used time manipulation as a method of simple adaptation in order to explore its effect on player experience (PX) and performance. Volunteers played a game in which the timer was adjusted based on their performance in the game, however they were not aware of the feature. The results showed that players in the experimental group found the game more immersive. This provides empirical support that dynamic difficulty adjustment could be used to improve the PX.

Title: Flow during Individual and Co-operative Gameplay

Abstract: This study aims to further research in the field of video games by examining flow during individual and co-operative gameplay. Using a puzzle game called Droppit, we examined differences in flow based on two modes of play: single player vs. co-operative gameplay. Co-operative gameplay was found to induce greater flow in participants than single player gameplay. Additionally, co-operative gameplay participants had increased feelings of Challenge-Skill Balance, Unambiguous Feedback, Transformation of Time and Autotelic Experience. Our findings suggest that co-operative gameplay, involving puzzle-based problems, may result in increased flow during video game play.

Title: Player Identity Dissonance and Voice Interaction in Games

Abstract: In the past half-decade, advances in voice recognition technology and the proliferation of consumer devices like the Microsoft Kinect have seen a significant rise in the use of voice interaction in games. While the use of player-to-player voice is widespread and well-researched, the use of voice as an input is relatively unexplored. In this paper we make the argument that notions of player and avatar identity are inextricable from the successful implementation of voice interaction in games, and consequently identify opportunities for future research and design.

Title: Arcade+: A Platform for Public Deployment and Evaluation of Multi-Modal Games

Abstract: We describe the design and implementation of Arcade+, a custom-built arcade machine augmented with modern input devices to deploy and evaluate novel multi-modal interaction techniques for gaming. Arcade+ has gaze, feet, mid-air gestures, and multi touch sensing capabilities, as well as traditional arcade controls. Our modular design also allows for extending current capabilities or replacing them with others. To demonstrate the system's capabilities, we describe and discuss three games that explore how multi-modal input can inspire new play concepts and mechanics.

Title: Low-Cost Gamification of Online Surveys: Improving the User Experience through Achievement Badges

Abstract: Gamification of online surveys has been shown to be effective for improving user experience and data quality. However, the precise effects of isolated game elements is unknown and survey gamification requires a lot of effort. This work proposes the use of just a single game element as a novel low-cost approach. It presents evaluation results from a case study where an existing survey was gamified using the popular game element of achievement badges. Results show that the badges improved the user experience but did not influence the respondents' behavior. These benefits are similar to related work but have been achieved with a lower effort. In summary, the case study indicates our low-cost approach to be viable and efficient for survey gamification, and achievement badges to be well-suited for gamified online surveys.

Title: Emotional and Functional Challenge in Core and Avant-garde Games

Abstract: Digital games are a wide, diverse and fast developing art form, and it is important to analyse games that are pushing the medium forward to see what design lessons can be learned. However, there are no established criteria to determine which games show these more progressive qualities.Grounded theory methodology was used to analyse language used in games reviews by critics of both 'core gamer' titles and those titles with more avant-garde properties. This showed there were two kinds of challenge being discussed --- emotional and functional which appear to be, at least partially, mutually exclusive. Reviews of 'core' and 'avant-garde' games had different measures of purchase value, primary emotions, and modalities of language used to discuss the role of audiovisual qualities. Emotional challenge, ambiguity and solitude are suggested as useful devices for eliciting emotion from the player and for use in developing more 'avant-garde' games, as well as providing a basis for further lines of inquiry.

Title: Playful Interactions in Public

Abstract: Governments, researchers, charities, schools, pubs, clubs and local communities all want to engage with the public to hear their opinions, involve them in events and get their commitment to sign up for initiatives and behavioral change programs. However, it is easier said than done. All, too, often only a small number take part while others shy away. How can technology be designed to encourage more active, diverse and sustained participation? How can technology be exploited to draw more people in that will champion causes, commit and even change the world? Instead of building yet another app, our 'out there' approach is to design tangible and physical interfaces, based on principles of playfulness, excitement, competitiveness, intrigue and pleasure. To truly engage with people in the public domain, however, needs us to be creative, colorful and daring in how we combine, mold and shape the form and context of physical and digital technologies.

Title: A Frank Conversation about the "F" Word

Abstract: With the rise of the independent game developer, and highly distributed platforms with low costs of entry we are seeing more and more content tailored to a specific group of people, be it tailored to a location, interest, or in many cases a disability. Organizations and institutions are using these new norms and are bring games to the market that attempt to obfuscate therapy, measure something specific to the disability, or just 'because' and the vast majority of these products are not widely adopted, or have a life in an institutional environment, but not at home. All of these projects miss the most important factor to any game, Fun.

Title: The False Dichotomy between Positive and Negative Affect in Game Play

Abstract: Most of the time games make us happy, but sometimes they are frustrating or make us feel sad. They allow us to experience pleasure, success and joy, but they can also yield feelings of frustration, failure, or sorrow from darker themes. In games, we can experience the full range of emotions -- both positive and negative. While a positive experience is often the goal, there are many ways in which negative affect can enhance play. First, the almost masochistic experience of failure and frustration within play can lead to intense positive feelings when overcome. Second, negative emotional experiences, such as feeling uncomfortable, guilty, or sad can also provide additional emotional range that is valued by players. Third, a number of games have emerged in recent years that encourage players to think about difficult or challenging issues that are unlikely to engender positive emotions.The CHIPLAY 2015 False Dichotomy Workshop focuses on the range of valence in games and invites experts from across fields to contribute to our understanding of the interplay between positive and negative affect within play. The workshop goals are to investigate the interplay between positive and negative affect, identify gaps in our knowledge, determine future research directions, and build the community of people interested in the false dichotomy between positive and negative affect in games. The workshop will consist of a brief introduction game, followed by group brainstorming, small group interaction, and a closing plenary discussion.

Title: Interdisciplinary Reflections on Games and Human Values

Abstract: We explore the interaction between digital games and human values. HCI as a field is increasingly focused on the importance of engaging with broader discussions around human values. Games are an ideal medium for reflecting on social, ethical and political questions. Accordingly, we propose a multidisciplinary workshop to discuss existing work, consider the future and bring together a range of different epistemological perspectives.

Title: Personalization in Serious and Persuasive Games and Gamified Interactions

Abstract: Serious and persuasive games and gamified interactions have become popular in the last years, especially in the realm of behavior change support systems. They have been used as tools to support and influence human behavior in a variety of fields, such as health, sustainability, education, and security. It has been shown that personalized serious and persuasive games and gamified interactions can increase effectivity of supporting behavior change compared to "one-size-fits all"-systems. However, how serious games and gamified interactions can be personalized, which factors can be used to personalize (e.g. personality, gender, persuadability, player types, gamification user types, states, contextual/situational variables), what effect personalization has (e.g. on player/user experience) and whether there is any return on investment is still largely unexplored. This full-day workshop aims at bringing together the academic and industrial community as well as the gaming and gamification community to jointly explore these topics and define a future roadmap.

Title: Tool Design Jam: Designing tools for Games User Research

Abstract: In both industry and academia, software tools are essential for games user research (GUR) in order to collect, integrate, analyze and report on games and players' data. GUR datasets are becoming more and more complex, detailed and multifaceted. Hence, tools are necessary to efficiently handle data. This one-day workshop explores the vast spectrum of tools used and created by current GUR researchers and provides a platform of discussion for advancing the development of such tools. This workshop will facilitate intersections from user researchers with diverse epistemologies, as well as from both academia and the industry, in an interactive Design Jam activity to collaboratively design future-proof GUR tools. The immediate outcome of the workshop is twofold: to collectively establish state-of-the-art tool design guidelines, and to archive the papers and discussions, which will extend the conversations and relationships beyond the workshop. Moreover, the long-term outcome will be the start of a community that focuses on creating better tools to aid the study of player experiences.

Title: An Ant's Life: Storytelling in Virtual Reality

Abstract: An Ant's Life is a game that explores the use of virtual reality in connection with physical props to tell a captivating story and create a unique immersive experience through innovation in graphics, gameplay and design. It takes a new approach to the virtual reality space by integrating 2D art in a 3D environment, including props and theming alongside the use of the Oculus Rift and PS Move and focusing on storytelling for naïve guests with an unusual perspective from the point of view of an ant. The game hopes to bridge the virtual and physical worlds and make virtual reality games more accessible to a wide audience.

Title: Ageing Playfully: Advancing Research on Games for Older Adults Beyond Accessibility and Health Benefits

Abstract: Games for older adults have previously been explored with a focus on improving older adults' well-being by fostering social interaction, and providing cognitive and physical stimulation, suggesting that they are a means of encouraging older adults to better themselves and introducing an overly functionalist perspective on play. In this workshop, we aim to shift perspectives on games for older adults on hedonic aspects that extend beyond benefits they provide. We will explore challenges and opportunities in the design and development of games for older adults that primarily focus on entertainment to create empowering and engaging experiences, and we will explore how to consolidate efforts that aim to deliver benefits of games with a purpose beyond entertainment to older adults.

Title: CHI PLAYGUE: A Networking Game of Emergent Sociality

Abstract: Modern professional networking is heavily reliant on social media. In recognition of this trend, we present CHI PLAYGUE, a conference game designed to facilitate interaction among strangers and encourage social networking to create a community. The game facilitates the emergence of social dynamics related to trust, allegiance, betrayal, selective interaction, and long-term strategic cooperation. By providing a platform for large-scale playful interaction, we will create an experience that will foster the development of mutually beneficial personal and professional relationships among players.

Title: Alaska Steve: Using Virtual Reality to Enhance a 2D Platforming Game

Abstract: Traditional virtual reality games foster immersion by giving the player a first-person perspective of a three-dimensional world. Alaska Steve: Bite Frost Back takes a different approach by using the Oculus Rift's orientation tracking as a core game mechanic for 2D platforming. The use of virtual reality allows the player to maintain context while navigating and manipulating the large two-dimensional game world as the main character travels through it. The game's obstacles complement the use of virtual reality by requiring the player to quickly scan the game world independently of the main character.

Title: Remembrance: Making Player Character's Inner World Playable

Abstract: Remembrance is an experimental puzzle platformer game we developed to explore new ways to make the character's inner world (e.g., memories, emotions, and imagination) playable. In this game, we used the landscape as a metaphor of the player character's inner world and gave the player the ability to transform the landscape through a core mechanic we call terraforming.

Title: Tangible Widgets for a Multiplayer Tablet Game in Comparison to Finger Touch

Abstract: Tangible widgets are graspable physical objects that can be detected by a capacitive touch screen. These are used as an interaction method in the tablet game "Hover Wars", a 2-player competitive combat game. Hover Wars was designed to work mainly with tangible widgets and the affordances thereof in mind. A version using finger touch was also implemented and the controls were changed to work optimally with this interaction method. The two versions were compared to each other in a user study, revealing that players tend to prefer the usage of tangible widgets over finger touch. The study also uncovers some advantages and disadvantages of using tangible widgets as an interaction method.

Title: Talk About Sex: Designing Games to Facilitate Healthy Discussions around Sex

Abstract: We report on the design of Talk About Sex, a multiplayer mobile phone game designed for young people to facilitate and enable discussions around the subjects of sex, intimacy and relationships. We discuss how we used 'sex as a framing for design', combining concepts of consent, subtlety, intimacy and trust to develop a sensitive yet dynamic game design.

Title: Penguin Peril: The Fun of Queuing Up!

Abstract: Queues have been around since the law of the jungle has been abandoned, and they are outdated, boring and time consuming structures. Time spent waiting is time wasted and possibly even frustrating if the waiting process does not occur in comfortable conditions. Entertaining people present in such a situation would improve their quality of life and could make them have a more positive mindset towards the event they were queuing for. Our solution not only entertains queue participants but also allows them to experience a group dynamic with other people in the queue making them enjoy the company of their fellow queue members instead of wishing they were the only one there. Who would have thought queues could ever become enjoyable experiences instead of time consuming structures.

Title: Matsya: A Cultural Game of Flow and Balance

Abstract: Matsya is a group project developed by seven students over two terms in a course on game design at Drexel University. Inspired by the Hindu Flood Myth, all art assets were developed to reflect design styles found in Indian culture. Intended to be played on iPad and to evoke a sense of balance and flow, the player must spin rings of water to help a fisherman catch fish and survive, while making sure not to overfish in the process. One of the primary intentions of the game's design is to introduce the player to aspects of a culture under-represented in Western games.

Title: "Beam Me 'Round, Scotty!": Studying Asymmetry and Interdependence in a Prototype Cooperative Game

Abstract: In "Beam Me 'Round, Scotty!", pairs of players engage with asymmetric gameplay mechanics and interfaces (e.g. leading vs. support, action vs. strategy, gamepad vs. mouse interaction) in a cooperative adventure to escape a hostile alien world. "Beam Me 'Round, Scotty!" presents a multi-faceted play experience designed to bridge differences in player skills, styles, and interests. By introducing deliberate interdependence through asymmetry, different types of players can come together and have fun overcoming obstacles, defeating enemies, and escaping the alien planet via their unique contributions.

Title: Brains & Brawn: A Strategy Card Game for Muscle-Strengthening Exercises

Abstract: Participation rates in muscle-strengthening programs are low. Exergames show promise in encouraging people to exercise, but it is difficult to build compelling games around resistance training. Games involve players making meaningful choices, but workout programs are rigidly structured, making it difficult to find opportunities for such choices. As such, most muscle-strengthening exergames have chosen between engaging gameplay and high quality exercise. To solve this issue, we have developed a muscle-strengthening card game -- Brains & Brawn -- that exploits and enhances player agency.

Title: Adaptive Engagement of Older Adults' Fitness through Gamification

Abstract: Many older adults lead sedentary lifestyles, as the challenges of aging can complicate efforts to maintain a healthy level of physical activity. These challenges can include decreasing strength, reduced mental capacity, social isolation, and the development of chronic health conditions. My PhD research attempts to analyze the needs and challenges of older adults and review their attitudes and motivations towards physical activity (PA). Furthermore, I aim to investigate various approaches in the development of socially interactive fitness activity programs, with the goal of increasing positive lifestyle motivations and quality of life (QoL). This research defines a taxonomy of motivational and personality characteristics of older adults to engage in PA. Lastly, this dissertation proposes the development of an adaptive application that addresses fitness gamification from the motivational perspective of an older adult. This application will empower older adults to engage in PA as a means to gain freedom, mobility and social interdependence within their public spheres.

Title: Super Starfish Mania: Fish for Friends

Abstract: Sedentary lifestyles are becoming increasingly common in modern society. Living like this does however increase the risks on health problems and diseases. Although research on this topic has been done, it has been inconclusive. Super Starfish Mania is an Android application that attempts to increase the user's awareness of sedentary behavior through the use of gamification. By using notifications, games, rewards, collaboration and progression, we encourage the user to periodically take short -- but active -- breaks during their days. Consistently taking these breaks eventually leads to healthier habits and a better understanding of an otherwise sedentary lifestyle.

Title: Determinants of Human Computation Game Acceptance

Abstract: Human computation games (HCGs) are information systems that use video games to harness human intelligence to solve large-scale problems that are beyond the capacity of artificial intelligence. HCGs present researchers with opportunities to solve computational problems in an enjoyable way. Despite their increasing popularity, insufficient research has been conducted to examine the predictors of players' acceptance for HCGs based on sound theoretical frameworks. This study proposed an integrated model that incorporates hedonic and utilitarian factors to predict players' acceptance of a HCG for music tagging.

Title: Examining the Impact Narrative Interactivity Has on Fostering Identity Formation in an Educational Game

Abstract: Educational games often include elements of narrative, although little work has been done on establishing how best to leverage narrative interactivity in service of a game's purpose. My ongoing research on narrative-centered games is guided by the situative perspective, which considers the ultimate purpose of a learning task to be the student's increased sense of belonging and identity with the subject matter. In my proposed dissertation research, I am particularly interested in how differing degrees of narrative interactivity support an educational game's potential to impact students' identity formation and attitudes towards the subject of study. I pursue this research in the context of an educational game for middle school computer science.

Title: User Experience of Mobile Proximity-Based Applications for Playful Social Interaction

Abstract: Mobile proximity-based connectivity technology like Wi-Fi Direct allows detecting nearby devices and establishing a direct data transfer between them. The opportunities provided by that are still underutilized. My doctoral research looks into proximity-based playful social interactions as a way to enhance interactivity between collocated people, both friends and strangers. I do qualitative user research on new research prototypes as well as on existing commercial systems like Nintendo's StreetPass.

Title: Investigating the Influence of Game Elements in Civic Engagement

Abstract: In my PhD thesis, I explore what elements in mobile e-participation (m-participation) tools encourage citizens' involvement in urban governance. My research aims to investigate how game elements such as achievement badges, reward systems and opportunities for social interaction can be utilized to achieve a continuous dialogue between a city and its citizens. Using prototypical m-participation systems, the effect of those elements is evaluated through user studies. The outcomes offer implications for both research and practice, who can benefit from resulting requirements for existing and future participation tools.

Title: Engagement Through Play: Politics and Video Games

Abstract: Many post-industrial democracies are experiencing a growing friction between electorate and institutional politics, leading to an overall decrease in citizens' political engagement. My research is investigating how video games may help to counter this by promoting political awareness and interest. Of particular importance for this are games? properties to incorporate learning and the role of knowledge in developing political engagement. An initial explorative study is described and future plans outlined.

Title: Dendrogram Visualization as a Game Design Tool

Abstract: With the advent of game telemetry, contemporary game designers have access to a huge amount of real-time data about player behavior. However, in design practice there is a lack of effective visualization tools. Activity histograms or heatmaps can suffer from data overcrowding, making it difficult for the designer to identify patterns and outliers within a large dataset. This work-in-progress explores a new meta-visualization tool for game designers that uses dendrogram representations to highlight pertinent features within large sets of heatmaps. Through interviews with professional game designers, we find that dendrograms can be used to identify outliers quickly, and are valuable in guiding designers through complex telemetry. This contributes to the ongoing work on supporting richer tools for game design practice amongst an increasingly data-filled environment.

Title: Towards Design Strategies for the Persuasive Gameplay Experience

Abstract: Games are increasingly used for purposes that stretch beyond their primary strength as medium for entertainment, including games used for training, education and critique. Among this stretch we also find games that argue a particular point of view; to shape attitudes and shift perspectives towards real-world concepts or objects. Unlike most contemporary media to persuade games are unique in their interactive affordances; providing players with the ability to evaluate given arguments to a system that responds, and essentially allows the player to engage in an indirect discussion with the designer(s). Although persuasion through games is not a new venue of research, the discipline unfortunately still lacks practical game design strategies aimed to aid designers in maximizing the persuasive potential of their games. The presented research is therefore concerned with how to design for persuasive gameplay and what strategies (models, frameworks, guidelines, methodologies, etc.) could support the designer throughout this design process.

Title: Modeling Routinization in Games: An Information Theory Approach

Abstract: Routinization is the result of practicing until an action stops being a goal-directed process. This paper formulates a definition of routinization in games based on prior research in the fields of activity theory and practice theory. Routinization is analyzed using the formal model of discrete-time, discrete-space Markov chains and information theory to measure the actual error between the dynamically trained models and the player interaction. Preliminary research supports the hypothesis that Markov chains can be effectively used to model routinization in games. A full study design is presented to further explore and verify this hypothesis.

Title: Exergame Development Using Body Composition Data for Obesity Care

Abstract: This study proposes an exergame for personal obesity management. This project called H-Run is implemented with a focus on exercise inducement for obese people. In this study, we particularly focus on aerobic exercises among the many obesity management exercise methods and develop them for enjoyment indoors.H-Run generates an avatar in the game by using the player's body composition data. Using the avatar reflecting his/her body type information, the player runs around the in-game spaces constructed on the basis of the actual environment. After finishing the game, the player can check the result of his/her actual exercises, and in the long term, the player can identify the body shape changes identical to those in the real environment. A pilot study showed that our H-Run game can potentially induce the players to exercise.

Title: Imperfect Robot Control in a Mixed Reality Game to Teach Hybrid Human-Robot Team Coordination

Abstract: A key component of team coordination in real-world practice involves communication and work execution from multiple perspectives; this is especially true for unmanned robotic system operators. Previously, such communication skills have been challenging to train, requiring many users and/or high-fidelity simulations. The present research develops a mixed reality game using a small robot and alternate roles to engage two players in team communication through information distribution. The robot features imperfect controls, creating challenge and reflecting the real-world context. This paper presents the game design and development challenges, reflecting on the value of mixed reality for training hybrid human-robot teams.

Title: Designing for Engaging BCI Training: A Jigsaw Puzzle

Abstract: Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology translates brain activity to machine-intelligible patterns, thus serving as input "device" to computers. BCI training games make the process of acquiring training data for the machine learning more engaging for the users. In this work, we discuss the design space for BCIraining games based on existing literature, and a training game in form of a Jigsaw Puzzle. The game was trialled with four cerebral palsy patients. All patients were very acceptant of the involved technology, which, we argue, relates back to the concept of BCI training games plus the adaptations we made. On the other hand, the data quality was unsatisfactory. Hence, in future work both concept and implementation need to be finetuned to achieve a balance between user acceptance and data quality.

Title: Exploring the Impact of Role Model Avatars on Game Experience in Educational Games

Abstract: Studies show that role models can boost academic performance. In this paper, we describe an experiment (N = 890) exploring the use of (a) scientist role models, (b) athlete role models and (c) simple geometric shapes, as game avatars. Using the Game Experience Questionnaire (GEQ), we find that over all participants, the use of avatars that looked like scientist and athlete role models led to highest flow and immersion. For female participants, the use of scientist avatars led to highest immersion and positive affect, and lowest tension and negative affect. The results here indicate that role model avatars have the potential to positively affect player game experience. This may especially be impactful for educational games, in which higher engagement could in turn influence learning outcomes.

Title: Understanding Player Attitudes Towards Digital Game Objects

Abstract: Humans collect; we examine this behavior in digital game contexts to understand how players' penchant for collecting items can inform game design. As part of an ongoing research agenda to understand player attitudes towards digital game objects, we conducted an online survey about player habits with interviews as future work. We present an initial analysis of our data. Our findings suggest that players value game objects most in Role-Playing Games (RPGs). Utility and Enjoyment were cited as the main reasons for a digital game objects' value, followed by Investment, Self-Expression and Memory. Dyes or color-changing features; physical placement adjustments; and naming or name-changing features were the most frequent personalization features desired for game object customization. We aim to improve game design through a deep understanding of player motivations regarding their game objects.

Title: Science and Gamification: The Odd Couple?

Abstract: This work-in-progress paper describes initial efforts to examine two opposite cases of citizen science projects, namely Galaxy Zoo and Foldit.Early findings from two case studies suggest that the use of gamification in these citizen science projects is contested. Statements from participants indicate that Foldit and Galaxy Zoo seem to fall, respectively, on the two dimensions of ludus and paidia, the former being rule-based and goal-oriented, and the latter being more oriented towards "playful experiences" in which participants can tap into motivations like curiosity and desire to learn.

Title: Game of Drones

Abstract: In response to the recent European Directive the UK government sanctioned the use of drones by commercial providers subject to pilots holding an approved Drone Pilot Proficiency Certificate (DPPC). As the government anticipated the main use has been in providing services to local authorities that aid in the enforcement of local by-laws. Whilst many commercial providers have followed the traditional path of employing dedicated enforcement officers to pilot the drones, in this paper we present on-going research that 'gamifies' the enforcment activities to allow members of the local community to act as enforcement officers. In particular we have worked with retired members of the police and armed services as drone pilots in relation to the enforcement of by-laws relating to parking offences and dog fouling in a small UK city. The initial results indicate that not only does this age group find the game-like activity enjoyable they feel that they are providing an important service to their community.

Title: Informational vs. Controlling Gamification: A Study Design

Abstract: Recent research suggests that gamification has the potential to increase intrinsic motivation, as well as decrease users' intrinsic motivation. However, the understanding of why gamification sometimes is successful and other times not, is still not fully understood. One reason for this is that applied research has been lacking a theoretical foundation. Therefore, we are currently designing a study in which we examine the underlying psychological mechanisms on how gamification works. Based on self determination theory, in our approach we compare how autonomy, competence and intrinsic motivation differ between an informational and a controlling condition.

Title: Uncomfortable yet Fun Messaging with Chachachat

Abstract: In order to improve user experience and to foster novel ideas, some voices in the HCI community have argued to break fundamental design rules, an approach well known in the art community.In this paper, we use this radical approach to design a playful mobile chat app called Chachachat, which allows users to send colorful 3-phrase messages from a limited set of phrases taken from dating websites and encourages intimate messaging with strangers with no possibility of meeting offline. We also present a case study of the usage of Chachachat in the wild over a period of six months and discuss ethical issues.

Title: Embracing Cheating in Gamified Fitness Applications

Abstract: Gamification of fitness applications opens the door to cheating by exploiting inherent limitations of sensing, in order to advance in the game without performing the required physical activity. While this type of behavior is usually conceptualized negatively, we propose it could actually be beneficial for encouraging physical activity. We integrate prior work on cheating in online games with prior work on embracing non-normative behavior, and suggest design opportunities for embracing cheating in gamified fitness applications.

Title: Guiding Young Players As Designers

Abstract: Players often have playfulness and motivation to play and make games on their own. By tapping into these instincts and guiding players in designing their own games to solve a problem, new models of collaboration between designers and players can be unlocked. In support of this, we present results from a five week case study with 25 children aged 8-10 where they designed their own games within a given context. This ongoing exploration resulted in three design themes: 1) Setting a common goal helps people design together, in this case using sensing data. 2) Focusing on spontaneity through autonomy. And 3) Supporting player mobility with the artefacts. We hope this ongoing exploration can be a starting point in aiding designers to guide players as designers.

Title: Play with your Food: Enjoyable Meals, Eatable Games

Abstract: This paper offers an approach that encourages children to play with food in a creative way. Children create video-games out of food while they cook or eat. We propose the use of Inventame, an App that allows the user to focus on the creative part. He crafts his own game in the real world with his preferred physical ingredients. Then, he takes a picture of his creation, configures a few options in the App, and the picture becomes playable. After this creative process, the user can play the digital version of his game once he has eaten the real one. This paper also describes four examples that illustrate the creation of playable food from several different ingredients and with different functions and playability.

Title: How Can I Interact?: Comparing Full Body Gesture Visualizations

Abstract: This paper is dedicated to the question "How can I interact?", which may arise during a full body interaction game. To answer this question, a game needs to tell the players what actions are available and how those actions can be triggered. We focus on the video channel and use onscreen symbols to visualize how available input gestures have to be performed. We describe three symbol variants using recordings of a real person: color images, tracking shapes and skeletons, and solely tracking skeletons. An initial evaluation study shows clear advantages for the color images. We further outline how we extend the current implementation, for both improving the usability of the symbols, as well as easing their development.

Title: Generating Consistent Game Levels

Abstract: Stochastic data for procedural content generation is rarely specified in research, and left up to the game designer. Extending an existing set of levels, however, requires their consideration in order to generate spatially consistent levels. Stochastic analysis techniques are adopted from musical composition research and applied to level generation, giving promising results in terms of spatial consistency.

Title: Validating Test Chambers to Study Cooperative Communication Mechanics in Portal 2

Abstract: Cooperative communication mechanics, such as avatar gestures or in-game visual pointers, enable player collaboration directly through gameplay. There remain open questions about how players use cooperative communication mechanics, and whether they can effectively supplement or even supplant traditional voice and chat communication. This paper describes a future study to investigate player communication in Portal 2, and chronicles the design and validation of test chambers for the study.

Title: Exploring Casual Exergames with Kids Using Wheelchairs

Abstract: Physical activity (PA) is important for health and well-being, but often PA is inaccessible for children using wheelchairs. In this work, we explore the potential of casual exergames to provide opportunities for physically active play. We apply existing wheelchair-controlled video games to explore children's and parents' perceptions of these games. Feedback shows that children and parents feel that casual exergames could be a valuable opportunity of offering wheelchair-accessible play, however, refinement of game concepts particularly regarding challenge and physical effort required to play is necessary. By integrating these findings into games for young people using wheelchairs in the future, we hope to provide opportunities for accessible and physically challenging play.

Title: Mobile and Sensor Integration for Increased Interactivity and Expandability in Mobile Gaming and Virtual Instruments

Abstract: AerialBeats is an interactive system that brings air drumming into reality. It comprises a set of drumsticks and feet bands equipped with motion sensors and a mobile application. AerialBeats brings a higher level of interactivity over standalone virtual drum mobile apps and digital drumsticks, yet retains the high ubiquity that is missing from physical drum sets. This creates a platform for learning, games and delivering entertaining performances. The integration of sensory hardware with mobile platform provides infinite possibilities for expansion interaction and customization surpassing physical instruments and mobile apps. In the larger context, this project seeks to 1) explore the benefits of bringing mobile interfaces into current standalone sensor equipment/toys and 2) utilize the addition of portable sensory hardware (e.g. wearables) to bring about a dimension to popular mobile gaming.

Title: StreetGamez: A Moving Projector Platform for Projected Street Games

Abstract: Moving Projector Platform (MPP) is a concept of using an autonomous vehicle, such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), commonly known as a 'drone', as a means to deliver and move the projection to arbitrary location. As a proof of concept this paper presents a design plan for a Moving Projector Game (MPG) called StreetGamez, which facilitates the game play through motion tracking and projection of a playing area, which can move and follow players in the game. This introduces novel abilities, such as: (i) to move the gaming platform before and during the game to the desired location and (ii) to free players from carrying the gaming equipment. Consequently this instigates possibilities to explore and study new exergame paradigms and players' attitudes towards the system as a whole. The concept also has the potential to provide a breakthrough in the social acceptance of drones in gaming scenarios whilst contributing to current debates on the legislation governing drone flights and furthering knowledge in human-drone interaction.

Title: Dead Fun: Uncomfortable Interactions in a Virtual Reality Game for Coffins

Abstract: Uncomfortable interactions are a common aspect of daily life, and have been explored in Human-Computer Interaction; yet little is known about uncomfortable gaming experiences. In this paper, we report on the design and preliminary evaluation of a game in which one player is invited to lie down in a coffin. Results of an exploratory user study suggest that the restricted space of the coffin along with its unsettling cultural connotation led to an engaging, thought provoking experience. By combining the previously separately explored dimensions of physical and psychological discomfort, we hope to better understand the effects that such challenges can have on player experience.

Title: Blind Running: Perceptual Team Interdependency for Self-less Play

Abstract: This paper introduces self-less play - a novel perspective upon how technology can foster teamwork through facilitating interpersonal interdependency. We illustrate this by presenting and analysing Blind Running - a wearable game platform comprising a pair of different headsets, each worn by one of two players standing back to back. The headsets deprive both wearers of directly seeing the world exterior to their helmet, but a camera on the outside of one helmet transmits live video of the environment for viewing by a screen on the interior of their partner?s helmet. We report upon initial playtests that set pairs the challenge of performing a variety of navigational and manual tasks against the clock. Participants and spectators found the experience provoking and entertaining. We offer four attention points to support developers interested in exploring the facilitating of self-less play through similar technical set ups.

Title: Heuristic Guidelines for Playful Wearable Augmented Reality Applications

Abstract: In recent years, new wearable platforms and peripherals requiring unique modes of interaction have been emerging in record numbers. Watches, necklaces, glasses, even pants [1] are beginning to incorporate technology. Wearable devices also offer many new ways for users to interact; therefore, more research is needed to evaluate these novel methods of interactions. Our research focuses on proposing a heuristic list to guide design and evaluation of wearable devices in playful applications. In this work-in-progress (WiP) article we show a prototype of a unique, playful, interaction application, META Museum, and propose the development of a heuristic list to evaluate it. This WiP reports on the early evaluation results based on user's inputs and discusses some common mistakes that users make and in what way this relates to how the application is designed.

Title: Agents and Avatars: Event based analysis of competitive differences

Abstract: Investigations into playing against computer and human controlled opponents have shown higher levels of arousal against human opponents. Most experiments however measure this by using post play surveys. In contrast, the study reported in this paper used physiological measurements to allow for different events during competitive play to be analysed. Twenty participants played two death matches in Call of Duty: Black Ops 2. Although participants played against an agent in both matches, participants were told that they were playing against an agent in one match, and an avatar in the other. Significant differences in participants' arousal level were found when the enemy was first encountered, though measures became more mixed as the interactions played out. The believability of the avatar may have influenced the results, as not all participants seemed convinced of the humanity of the AI. Overall, the experimental results can form a basis for further investigation into this area.

Title: Air Tandem: A Collaborative Bodily Game Exploring Interpersonal Synchronization

Abstract: In this paper we introduce a game design that utilizes the synchronization and flow of the movement in contrast to the pace of movement (speed) utilized in many exertion games. We present Air Tandem, a bodily game that explorers synchronized limb movements to move a shared avatar from a start to a finish line on a projected route. The game is designed for a two player team. In the future we plan to use this game to gain insight on the sensory cues the players use to achieve synchrony.

Title: Towards Understanding the Importance of Co-Located Gameplay

Abstract: Analyzing the social con¬text present in a gameplay environment and its effect on player experience can provide insights informing the design and social value of games. We investigate the influence of social condition (cooperative or competitive play with a human player versus computer-controlled character) on player experience. The study controlled for co-presence by ensuring that another individual attending to the same stimulus was present in all conditions. Although physiological measures were not significant, subjective measures of arousal and pleasure were significantly different under varying conditions.

Title: Grand Push Auto: A Car Based Exertion Game

Abstract: Grand Push Auto is an exertion game in which players aim to push a full sized car to ever increasing speeds. The re-appropriation of a car as essentially a large weight allows us to create a highly portable and distributable exertion game in which the main game element has a weight of over 1000 kilograms. In this paper we discuss initial experiences with GPA, and present 3 questions for ongoing study which have been identified from our early testing: How might we appropriate existing objects in exertion game design, and does appropriation change how we think about these objects in different contexts, for example environmental awareness? How does this relate to more traditional sled based weight training? How can we create exertion games that allow truly brutal levels of force?

Title: The Player is Chewing the Tablet!: Towards a Systematic Analysis of User Behavior in Animal-Computer Interaction

Abstract: There is an increasing demand for digital games developed for pets, in particular for dogs and cats. However, play interactions between animals and technological devices still remain an uncharted territory both for animal behavior and user-computer interaction communities. While there is a lot of anecdotal evidence of pets playing digital games, the nature of animal-computer play interactions is far from being understood. In this work-in-progress we address the problem of analyzing and interpreting user behavior in such interactions using the tool of ethograms from applied ethology, which are catalogs of typical behavior patterns.

Title: From Classes to Mechanics: Player Type Driven Persuasive Game Development

Abstract: Research findings indicate that player types may serve as a theoretical basis for the design of persuasive games. However, until now no proof of concept is available that shows the applicability of this approach for tailoring games to player characteristics. We suggest a solution by formulating design concepts and by creating game prototypes that are driven by player types. Our strategies are composed of the three characteristics: first, design choices are based on the BrainHex player type model. Secondly, the concepts consider individual player styles and mechanics tailored to the various player types. Third, these individual game elements are combined into one game world. In order to evaluate our concepts we created two mobile game prototypes that foster physical activity. These prototypes are based on the Seeker and the Mastermind player type of the BrainHex model. First findings reveal that the usage of player types appears to be effective. Our efforts should enable designers to create persuasive games that are both engaging for individual players and allow the integration of several player types.

Title: Extending the Impact of Digital Games by Supporting Analogical Reasoning

Abstract: The potential of digital games to support learning has been well documented, and yet the empirical evidence on the impacts of digital games on student learning finds varied effects. This paper explores an issue that we believe is central to realizing the potential of digital games for influencing learning: the relationship between games and the transfer of knowledge, and specifically the need to support the meaningful integration of games into instruction. We examine the theoretical and empirical literature on how middle-grade students can transfer knowledge and skills gained from digital gameplay to develop new conceptual models of the science concepts that the games target, focusing on the research on the use of analogical reasoning in science. Finally, we illustrate this approach with an example of using analogies with digital games in middle school science classes.

Title: SHAPIO: Shape I/O Controller for Video Games

Abstract: In this paper, we propose "SHAPIO"', a game controller that inputs and outputs game events through its three-dimensional shape. SHAPIO consists of multiple triangular prisms, and its three-dimensional shape can be freely changed by twisting each prism. When a game player changes the shape of SHAPIO, the game system changes the shape of an item in the game into the same shape as SHAPIO, and vice versa. The player can feel the sense of unity with the game character, because SHAPIO always has the same shape as the item. We confirmed that the shape of our prototype could go hand-in-hand with the corresponding game item in a practical response time.

Title: Placeholder Content in Game Development: Benefits and Challenges

Abstract: Literature on game design and development recommends using placeholder content and assets as a technique for, amongst other things, working around production bottlenecks (e.g. needs music to work but music is not ready) and streamlining development (e.g. focus on the "fun", without getting distracted by the art). However, this commonly accepted practice can cause problems that are rarely discussed or presented. We unpack this practice by discussing some of its issues. As a practice that is central to game development, it is important to better understand the interactions of social, technical, and cultural factors that result in the creation of sophisticated software artifacts, i.e. computer games. We discuss some of these issues and sketch out a research agenda for their further exploration.

Title: Wordcraft: Playing with Sentence Structure

Abstract: We introduce Wordcraft, a new interactive tablet application that allows children to explore sentence structures and their meanings. Wordcraft uses a constructionist design: children manipulate word cards to build sentences, which come to life in a storybook-like animated world to illustrate meaning. Such visual feedback helps children play with parts of speech and understand how they fit together to form sentences. Preliminary studies suggest that children are able to observe and discuss how different sentence constructs result in different meanings.

Title: Paper Gaming: Creating IoT Paper Interactions with Conductive Inks and Web-connectivity through EKKO

Abstract: Paper is ubiquitous. It forms a substantial part of our everyday activities and interactions; ranging from our take-away coffee cups -- to wallpaper -- to rail tickets -- to board and card games. Imagine if you could connect paper to the Internet, interact and update it with additional data but without recourse to reprinting or using e-ink alternatives. This paper explores work examining conductive inks and web-connectivity of printed objects, which form part of an emergent sub-field within the Internet of Things (IoT) and paper. Our research is starting to explore a range of media uses, such as interactive newspapers, books, beer mats and now gaming environments through prototype IoT device named EKKO; a clip that allows conductive ink frameworks to detect human touch interaction revealing rich media content through a mobile application as the 'second screen'.

Title: Training While Playing?: Enhancing Cognitive Control Through Digital Games

Abstract: The rapidly increasing number of commercially game-based brain trainings offers great possibilities for applied interventions, but often warrant evidence for improved functioning. In contrast, established scientific training tasks often lack motivational layout and hence challenge training willingness. As a first step, we present three games for tablet PCs targeting different processes of cognitive control. All of these apps involve motivational elements to increase training willingness. In future work, having different versions of gamed-based cognitive control training will facilitate whether cognitive training in one function generalizes to training benefits in another, and which specific feature of the game-layout supports intrinsic training motivation.

Title: Racetime: Telepresence Racing Game with Multi-user Participation

Abstract: In this study, we implemented a telepresence racing game that enables real-time, face-to-face interaction between the players. Both the spatial and social aspects of presence were achieved by integrating mature devices, which resulted in commercial RC cars equipped with both smartphones and augmented reality tags. Users drove their cars using the physical RF controllers and the interaction between the RC cars and the environment were guided by two laptops (one for each player) using a Wi-Fi network. Finally, a field demonstration was conducted and avenues for future studies are suggested.

Title: UKKO: Enriching Persuasive Location based Games with Environmental Sensor Data

Abstract: The number of children walking to school is at an all-time low and car use on the rise. The walk to school is seen as an opportunity to promote exercise and tackle the effects of an increasingly sedentary lifestyle amongst young people. At the same time we have a growing understanding of the harmful effects of air pollution on our health. Walking to school would not only make for healthier kids, it would reduce traffic and create a healthier, safer environment but we still drive our kids to school. This paper describes the initial design and development of UKKO, a novel persuasive game to encourage walking to school and engagement with local data. UKKO uses real time environmental data captured by the player to create a virtual environment for a digital pet. The more the student walks and avoids areas of high pollution the more healthy their pet.

Title: The Potentials of Gamification to Motivate Older Adults to Participate in a P2P Support Exchange Platform

Abstract: Gamification has gained popularity in the research community and has been studied in various contexts lately. In a research project, we aim at establishing a peer-to-peer exchange platform that supports informal care practices of older adults by mediating them online. Current research around gamification brought out our curiosity and we decided to investigate the potentials for motivating older adults to benefit from support exchange and characterizing them by showing badges in their profile. Thereby, we aim at positioning gamification in the form of rewards in the care context with a clear meaning for older adults.

Title: Investigating Perspectives on Play: The Lenses of Play Tool

Abstract: This paper presents a new design tool for developing interactive playful environments. This design tool consists of a number of cards, which explain five perspectives or lenses on play. We describe three user evaluations that were carried out with the design tool and discuss how participants used the tool in their design activities and what they considered to be the value of the tool. The evaluations where mainly focused on two lenses: open-ended play and emergence. The tool provides inspiration for students, and other design researchers and practitioners working in the field of interactivity and play.

Title: The Rhythm's Going to Get You: Music's Effects on Gameplay and Experience

Abstract: Music exerts powerful effects on human performance, behavior, and experience, yet very little is understood about how they are affected by game music. This paper describes a works-in-progress study examining the effects of music and music tempo on game play performance, behavior, and experience in a cognitive game. We found that music influenced mouse activity not directly related to game play, and increased players' feelings of flow.

Title: Measuring Implicit Science Learning with Networks of Player-Game Interactions

Abstract: Visualizing player behavior in complex problem solving tasks such as games is important for both assessing learning and for the design of content. We collected data from 195 high school students playing an optics puzzle game, Quantum Spectre, and modeled their game play as an interaction network, examining errors hypothesized to be related to a lack of implicit understanding of the science concepts embedded in the game. We found that the networks were useful for visualization of student behavior, identifying areas of student misconceptions and locating regions of the network where students become stuck. Preliminary regression analyses show a negative relationship between the science misconceptions identified during gameplay and implicit science learning.

Title: SnackBreaker: A Game Promoting Healthy Choice of Snack Foods

Abstract: In this paper we present a simple mobile game that we have developed with an intention of promoting the players' healthy choice of snack foods. While playing the game, the players are continuously given to choose their preference between two snacks until the final winner is decided. During the gameplay, various nutrition facts and information on the snacks are provided to the players to facilitate their choices.We conducted a study with 38 participants and interviewed them about the gameplay. The study results show that 36 percents of the participants are willing to change their eating habits for better health and 55 percents of the respondents mentioned that their interest and attention in the food information increased. The interview results from the participants suggests that the game can effectively help the players (or customers) choose snack foods in the market through the information provided by the gameplay.

Title: User Reviews of Gamepad Controllers: A Source of User Requirements and User Experience

Abstract: The development of the digital games industry has motivated game console makers to provide better gamepads for gamers. As gamepads provide the interaction between digital games and gamers, it is important to understand gamers' requirements for these devices. This study used content analysis to investigate whether existing gamepads satisfy gamers' requirements and provide good game experience, with a view to informing new designs. A content analysis of user reviews of four different game consoles was conducted. An emergent coding scheme with 11 categories was developed. 'Comfort' was the most frequently mentioned category, accounting for nearly 25% of all comments in the reviews. 'Material Quality' and 'Responsiveness' yielded the most negative comments. Implications for design improvements are discussed.

Title: Collaborate, Not Only as a Developer, but also as a PLAYER

Abstract: More and more players are participating in creating game content. The tools for player generation of game level content have increasingly rich functionality and capabilities, often rivaling developer tools. However, unlike the dedicated agile sprints of developers, players often have long iterations for the build-test cycle and rarely hear feedback from other players. All of these factors make it frustrating for players to finish and polish their creations. This paper introduces a new way for players to generate game level content by collaborating with another player as the level tester in real-time, thereby integrating the build-test cycle directly into a new type of gameplay.

Title: Responsive Environmental Diegetic Audio Feedback for Hand Gestures in Audio-Only Games

Abstract: Touch-less hand gestures require a structured approach towards the design of audio feedback, especially in audio-only environments. We present an implementation approach for responsive audio feedback geared towards hand gestures in audio-only games, focusing on diegetic environmental feedback before, during, and after gestures. The developed framework is used in a project investigating the usefulness of different feedback designs. Preliminary results suggest that the implemented game variants are both rated highly in terms of usability and enjoyment, and that replacing explicit audio instructions for hand positions and movements with responsive audio feedback for suggesting interaction methods using environmental story-related audio cues leads to higher immersion.

Title: WearLove: Affective Communication via Wearable Device with Gamification

Abstract: In this paper, we present WearLove, a wrist-worn device and mobile application for enhancing affective communication between users. It enables two users to send a heart symbol to each other's wristband monitors by touching the sensor on the band. Given that the gamification causes the user motivation, we add the gamification elements to the app. The more they express their love to each other via the wristband, the bigger a tree will be grown in the app. By using WearLove, we would like to figure out it can actually enhance the affective communication between users. Add to this, we also investigate the gamification elements in the app can evoke the user motivation for affective communication. To address these questions, three group interviews were conducted during one hour for each couple. (N = 6, 3 couples) Results indicated that WearLove may evoke user motivation for affective communication. Key findings and limitations are going to be discussed in the paper.

Title: An interactive exploratory search system for on-line apparel shopping

Abstract: Many people (especially women) tend to take relatively longer time for shopping. This paper presents a system for product retrieval inspired by psychology of women's shopping activity, and an implementation of the system for apparel products. Our study supposes products which pre-defined keywords are assigned, and prepares icons representing the combination of the keywords. The system intuitively displays various icons in a display space to demonstrate the diversity of the products. When a user selects an interested icon, the system switches the display to a set of images corresponding to the selected icon, so that the user can visually compare the similar products. The system also features user interfaces to input the preference of users, and reflects the input to the evolutionary computation which adjusts the selection of icons to their preferences. It acts real shopping behavior because we often firstly look over the shops to understand the diversity of products, and then close up the particular groups of the products. This paper introduces an experiment which demonstrates the preferable assistance of the shopping behavior of women who are interested in various products.

Title: A Preliminary Study on Network-based ADL Training for the Visually Impaired by Use of a Parametric-speaker Robot

Abstract: This report proposes a network-based robot that can perform the interactive training of activities in daily life (ADL) for the visually impaired. The robot has a pan-tilt head equipped with a parametric speaker and a USB camera. A sighted trainer can observe the situation of a visually impaired trainee, and control the pan-tilt head to communicate with the trainee over the network. The trainer's voice is outputted from the parametric speaker and then reflected on the surface of a target object. The visually impaired trainee can hear the reflected voice as if it is generated from the object, and thus the robot can let the trainee know the object position. This robot system is applied to the ADL training where visually impaired individuals learn to use various objects arranged in their living environments. In this report, the experimental results of user study are shown.

Title: HistoryPaper: A Magazine-Style Layout of Representative Web Pages Extracted From Browsing History

Abstract: Web browsing history of people who use internet everyday represents processes they learned. Visualization of summarized browsing history can contribute to learn what we did. This paper proposes HistoryPaper, a system to extract representative Web pages from browsing history of users, and arranges them like a newspaper. The system helps users to remember what they did in a particular day. HistoryPaper firstly clusters browsed Web pages based on their contents. Then, it calculates the priority of Web pages from search terms and rality of accessed Web pages, and selects the representative page of each cluster. HistoryPaper arranges the representative pages by utilizing a layout algorithm following the magazine style applied in many news sites. This paper presents the numeric evaluation of the layout results to demonstrate the reasonableness of the algorithm.

Title: On the Utility of Large High-Resolution Displays for Comparative Scientific Visualisation

Abstract: In many disciplines, such as computer aided drug design, multiple simulation runs are performed with varying parameters, yielding ensembles of data sets. Comparative visualisation of these simulation results can help understanding the influence of different parameters. However, researchers might need to compare large numbers of variants. Single desktop monitors often do not have the resolution and screen size required for showing a whole ensemble at once with sufficient detail. Wall-sized high-resolution displays can be a solution for this problem. Although a number of studies has been conducted on how large high-resolution displays affect the speed and accuracy of certain tasks, only few of them are related to actual scientific visualisation tasks. We built a system for comparative visualisation of simulation results that can be used with conventional desktop monitors and with large high-resolution displays. We conducted a study using biochemical simulation data to evaluate the impact of screen size and 3D stereo display on a comparison task.

Title: The Interface Design for Serendipity with Collective Intelligence

Abstract: The authors' research theme is to give the useful and new insight of daily life which cannot get their actual world from the internet to the ordinary people. In this paper, we want to discuss about the "serendipity" to follow the previous theme. Serendipity has been attracted attention at the point of the system of information retrieval. However, in this paper, we want to focus to the interface design to publish the information. We will show some of our works which are designed by the point of the interface design for serendipity.

Title: Digital Artwork Creation Using Water and Sand on a Two-Dimensional Surface

Abstract: In this paper, we developed a system which enables users to draw pictures of sand and water on a two-dimensional surface in a virtual environment. By mixing water and sand for artwork creation, we can create different styles of pictures. Our system has three major subsystems: water animation system, sand animation system and rendering system. In the simulation part, we compute the motion of sand and water based on the interactions for water-water, sand-water and sand-sand. In the rendering part, we attempt to balance the rendering quality and the computation cost. We render water using a ray tracing method and the sand is rendered with shadow. Thus, the rendered results of water and sand look like 2.5D. We tested our system and the experimental results showed that the users could create a variety of pictures of sand and water.

Title: Dynamic Graph Visualization with Multiple Visual Metaphors

Abstract: Visualizing dynamic graphs is challenging due to the many data dimensions to be displayed such as graph vertices and edges with their attached weights or attributes and the additional time dimension. Moreover, edge directions with multiplicities and the graph topology are also important inherent features. However, in many dynamic graph visualization techniques each graph in a sequence is treated the same way, i.e., it is visually encoded in the same visual metaphor or even in the same layout. This visualization strategy can be problematic if the graphs are changing topologically over time, i.e., if a sparse graph becomes denser and denser over time or a star pattern is changing into a dense cluster of connected vertices. Such a dynamic graph data scenario demands for a visualization approach which is able to adapt the applied visual metaphor to each graph separately. In this paper we show an idea to solve this problem by using multiple visual metaphors for dynamic graphs which are computed automatically by algorithms analyzing each individual graph based on a given repertoire of graph features. The biggest issue in this technique for the graph dynamics, however, is the preservation of the viewer's mental map at metaphor changes, i.e., to guide him through the graph changes with the goal to explore the data for time-varying patterns. To reach this goal we support the analyst by an interactive highlighting feature.

Title: Interactive Visual Analysis of Temporal Text Data

Abstract: This paper presents a novel interactive visualization technique that helps in gathering insights from large volumes of text generated through dyadic communications. The emphasis is specifically on showing content evolution and modification with passage of time. The challenge lies in presenting not only the content as a stand-alone but also understand how the present is related to the past. For example analyzing large volumes of emails can show how communication among a set of people have progressed or evolved over time, may be along with the roles of the communicators. It can also show how the content has changed or evolved. In order to depict the changes, the email repositories are first clustered using a novel algorithm. The clusters are further time-stamped and correlated. User-insights are provided through visualization of these clusters. Results of implementation over two different datasets are presented.

Title: Visual Cyber Situational Awareness for Critical Infrastructures

Abstract: The increasing number of security accidents, due to failures or cyber attacks, that critical infrastructures/smart grids are experimenting is pushing researchers to investigate on the different issues associated with such a problem. Among them, an increasing attention has been devoted to the development of monitoring systems that exploit geographical data about the network under control. This papers focuses on situational awareness and describes a Visual Analytics solution for monitoring and put in tight relation data from network level (computers, routers, etc.) with organization's mission. The goal of the proposed solution is to make security officers aware of both the actual network endangerment level and the impact it actually has on the infrastructure mission, making clear the relationships and the responsibilities that exist between the network level and the business level. The solution proposed is then instantiated on ACEA infrastructure, a company that provides power and water purification services to cities in central Italy (millions of end users).

Title: Synchronizing Digital Signage Content with the Movement of Passerby

Abstract: The use of digital signage systems is increasingly common in public spaces such as shopping malls, train stations, airports and urban areas. In this paper, we present a new interaction scheme for digital signage that allows the passerby to keep him/her walking while getting a series of information. The innovative features of our system include estimation of the passerby's eye level based on features of gait on a pressure sensing floor mat device, and presentation of a 3D content considering his/her eye level.

Title: The Fantastic Voyage: an arts-led approach to 3D virtual reality visualization of clinical stroke data

Abstract: Stroke survivors directly link stroke education with their ability to access appropriate treatments and reduce their risk of future strokes. However, with such a diverse population a universal mode of delivering education must be sought. This paper places the artist at the heart of educating patients and carers about their disease by developing a technical process of delivering 3D CT patient stroke data on the Virtual Reality (VR) platform Oculus Rift DK2. VR has already been proven as an efficacious rehabilitation tool for this population but its use in education has not yet been established. This work is being piloted in a new collaboration between the Art & Design Faculty at the University of New South Wales, Australia and the Stroke Rehabilitation Service at St Vincent's Hospital in Sydney. Importantly, this paper places the artist's at the center of the process -- from developing the concept, to prototyping and creating the final visual aesthetic. The different stages of the technical design process are also described in this paper. These provide an early framework for working with VR in a clinical context.The practicalities and pitfalls of navigating vascular datasets in immersive real-time 3D on VR are discussed at the end of this paper. Several recommendations for the future development of this process and its scalability for clinical use are made.

Title: Consistently GPU-Accelerated Graph Visualization

Abstract: Graph visualization is essential for the analysis of networks and relational data sets. Often, most of the effort is expended on computing sophisticated layouts of the visual representation of the graph. Even though this is increasingly accelerated by use of graphics processing units (GPUs), the rendering is often considered as circumstantial. In this paper, we present a coherent approach to graph visualization that utilizes all features of modern GPUs. We describe specialized data structures and our GPU-centric pipeline for computing and rendering a layout, while enabling steering and interaction. We evaluate technical aspects of our approach as well as its applicability to huge real-world graphs.

Title: Predictive Visual Analytics using Topic Composition

Abstract: Digital big data provide the vast potential of increasing effectiveness and efficiency for decision making. Since the volume of the data is enormous, the data analysis requires large amount of time and effort. It is more problematic when predictive analysis is necessary for futuristic decision making. In order for predictive analysis, there have been many studies to forecast future trends spatiotemporally. However, most of studies provide just future tendency per event using graphs or maps without contextual compositive analysis. In this paper, we present a predictive visual analytics system to provide predictive event patterns. We infer the future event evolution by combining contextually similar cases occurring in the past. We utilize social media data to detect interesting abnormal events and match the detected abnormal events within the past news media data in order to retrieve similar event patterns. Then, we extract future event patterns through compositing contextual relationship among topics included in the similar past patterns. In order to evaluate our VA system, we demonstrate two use cases in this paper and validate our system with possible predictive story lines.

Title: In-Situ Visualisation of Fractional Code Ownership over Time

Abstract: The term code ownership is used in software engineering to describe who authored a certain piece of software. Code ownership is commonly determined by investigating the data from version control systems, defining the owner as the person who contributed the most lines to a file, module, etc. Existing visualisation for ownership usually relies on per-line annotations from the version control system, thus only conveying the information who changed a line the last time, potentially adding some visual cue about how old the respective change is. This, however, can be misleading, because any change of even a single character changes ownership. In this paper, we propose a visualisation that accounts for fractional ownership changes over time on a per-character basis. Our technique incorporates visual cues to convey that typical definitions of ownership have an inherent uncertainty and provides details on the cause of this uncertainty on demand. For our definition of code ownership being a low-level one, we propose implementing the visualisation as an in-situ visualisation in the code editor of modern development environments. We will show examples of the efficacy of our approach and discuss its advantages and disadvantages compared to conventional line-based ownership.

Title: Enhanced Hexagon-Tiling Algorithm for Map-Like Information Visualisation

Abstract: Hierarchical information is ubiquitous, and analysing such information is one of the common tasks performed by its users. Map-like visualisations, which resemble geographic maps, can be a useful tool for perceiving hierarchical information. Maps have the advantage that the majority of ordinary users can easily understand them without prior training. This paper presents a novel method for visualising hierarchical data in a form resembling a geographic map, using hexagon tiling. Our method can be used for visualising general hierarchical data, such as organisational structures, library catalogues, file systems, and many more. Like treemaps, our new method is area-based, thus it not only reveals hierarchy but also other attributes. Unlike treemaps, however, our method produces visualisations that resemble geographic maps in shape and appearance. Several tactics are employed to control the space-division process and aspect ratio. In this paper we present experiments involving our visualisation, evaluations of results, comparisons with other methods, and discuss advantages and potential issues.

Title: Remote Rendering and User Interaction on Mobile Devices for Scientific Visualization

Abstract: Scientific data is typically analyzed using visualizations. Large high-resolution displays can facilitate the analysis process since they offer more screen real estate than desktop monitors, which allows visualizing more data in greater detail and working collaboratively. On the other hand, mobile devices like smartphones and tablets are getting more and more popular but do not have sufficient graphics capabilities for advanced scientific visualizations. In this paper, we discuss a client application for Android devices that allows to remote control a scientific visualization framework. Combining the power of remote rendering with the availability, flexibility, and mobility of mobile devices results in a ubiquitous computing solution for scientific visualization. The user interaction with a large high-resolution display is only one possible application scenario. Other scenarios include presentation of results and remote visualization. The design of our Android application fulfills the requirement of all these application scenarios.

Title: Vision-Based Technique and Issues for Multimodal Interaction in Augmented Reality

Abstract: Although many progresses have been accomplished in multimodal interaction, most researchers still treat each modality such as vision and speech, separately. They integrate the results at the application stage. This is because the roles of multiple modalities and their interactions continue to be quantified and precisely understood. However, there are many remaining issues in combining each modality individually. This paper will highlight the main vision problems based on our review for multimodal applications. This review paper will give an overview of the Augmented Reality (AR) technologies which are contributing in most of recent multimodal applications. We cluster vision techniques according to the natural human senses such as face, gesture, and speech that are frequently used in multimodal applications. The main contribution of this paper is to consolidate some of the main issues and approaches in vision-based technique, and to study some of the applications in AR that have been developed within the context of multimodal interaction. We conclude this paper with the future directions.

Title: The Graph Landscape: a Concept for the Visual Analysis of Graph Set Properties

Abstract: In a variety of research and application areas graphs are an important structure for data modeling and analysis. While graph properties can have a crucial influence on the performance of graph algorithms, and thus on the outcome of experiments, often only basic analysis of the graphs under investigation in an experimental evaluation is performed, and a few characteristics are reported in publications.We present Graph Landscape, a concept for the visual analysis of graph set properties. The Graph Landscape aims to support researchers to explore graphs and graph sets regarding their properties, in order to allow to select good experimental test sets, analyze newly generated sets, compare sets and assess the validity (or range) of experimental results and corresponding conclusions.

Title: Metaphoric Transfer Effect in Information Visualization Using Glyphs

Abstract: Metaphor is the underlying mechanism of information communication. Although metaphors are ubiquitous in information visualization designs, different connotations influence users' information processing dissimilarly. However, visual metaphors imply interfering attributes caused by the source concepts, and lead to backfire effects on users' inferences. Understanding the pros and cons of metaphoric transfer effect in information visualization would help optimizing visualization designs, and improve efficiency and accuracy of information processing. This study empirically examines how metaphors influence different activities of information processing, including comprehension, inference and judgment in information visualization. Metaphors illustrating strongly implying semantic meanings in source domain can improve both the user's conceptual fluency in information comprehension, and the rate of correctness in information searching.

Title: Enabling Finger-Gesture Interaction with Kinect

Abstract: A large number of tracking and gesture recognition algorithms and technologies have been developed in the field of human-computer interactions thanks to the introduction of cameras with depth sensors such as Microsoft's Kinect. Most of the techniques rely on skeleton tracking which is more suitable for distant and full body interaction. This paper presents a new real-time finger-gesture interaction system using Kinect v2 that identifies fingertips and finger gestures that enable the natural user interaction at a close distance. Our contribution also includes various gesture recognition algorithms using two and three fingers such as L-gesture, OK-gesture, Rock-gesture and Scissor-gesture, in addition to full hand and one-finger gestures. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system through a fruit slicing game.

Title: An Interactive Radial Visualization of Geoscience Observation Data

Abstract: Geoscience observation data refers to the datasets consisting of time series of multiple parameters generated from the sensors at fixed locations. Although a few works have attempted to visualize features of these data, none of them views these data as a specific type and attempts to show the overview in all the space, time and attribute aspects. It is important for domain experts to select interested subsets from huge amounts of observation data according to the high level patterns shown in the overview. We present a novel approach to visualizing geoscience observation data in a compact radial view. Our solution consists of three visual elements. A map showing the spatial aspect is in the center of the visualization, while temporal and attribute aspects are seamlessly combined with the spatial information. Our approach is equipped with interactive mechanisms for highlighting the selected features, adjusting the display range, as well as interactively generating a fisheye view. We demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of our approach with a usability experiment. Eye tracking records and user feedbacks obtained in the experiment prove the effectiveness of our approach.

Title: Exploring the Benefits of Text and Sketch in Video Retrieval of Complex Queries

Abstract: The booming of mobile devices and networks leads to an explosive growth in video resources. Efficient video research styles are appealing for facilely exploring video content appropriate to user's intention with a low cognitive load. The style of input becomes particularly relevant during the process of finding a target video clip in a large-scale database on tablets or other mobile devices. Some users have strong allegiance to input text, while others only input sketches. In this paper, we present the first systematic comparison of these two input styles and analyze the responses and feedbacks of users. An elaborated user study was conducted to test two different styles of inputting the semantics. Some users preferred to text input because it could describe their objective easily in a short time, yet some users also liked sketch because it helped illustrate the action or orientation clearly and immediately. Combining text with sketch ("sketch-text") is efficient for searching video of complex queries. The evaluation results show users' enjoying "sketch-text" and its higher performance than other input styles.

Title: On Clustered Graph Layouts Sketched by Users Based on Predefined Clusters

Abstract: The aesthetics for user-sketched layouts of clustered graphs with known clustering information is analyzed empirically. In our experiments, given the adjacency list of a clustered graph and its predefined clustering information, each participant was asked to manually sketch clustered graphs "nicely" from scratch on a tablet system using a stylus. The main feature of this work different from the previous work is to investigate if the user's complex task of sketching clustered graphs "nicely" can be alleviated by providing the cluster partition information. Results show that most participants can draw graphs with clear presence of bridge edges and clustering cohesiveness.

Title: A Projection-based Medical Augmented Reality System

Abstract: In this paper, we present a projection-based medical augmented reality (AR) system for craniofacial application. With the aid of image registration and geometrical correction, the deformation of the projected image on a curved surface like cheek or forehead can be successfully recovered. From the experimental result, it is shown that the overlapped target region is up to 98% after the correction process and this demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed system.

Title: Interactive Visualization of Quantitative Data with G2D3

Abstract: This article introduces G2D3, an implementation of the grammar of graphics in JavaScript, along with two practical use cases that illustrate its practicability. It makes it possible to generate interactive visualization of quantitative data in HTML/SVG. Compared to traditional static data visualization systems such as those featured in Excel and R, G2D3 makes it possible to greatly enhance the amount of conveyed information by means of animation and interaction. Compared to other JavaScript plotting libraries such as Raphaël and D3, G2D3 leverages the expressiveness and the flexibility of the grammar of graphics to concisely generate complex visualization with many plotting dimensions, including time. It makes it possible to create a wide range of graphics with a few lines of code. G2D3 is open source and hosted in GitHub: join us!

Title: A Layout Technique for Storyline-based Visualization of Consecutive Numerical Time-varying Data

Abstract: We commonly represent time-varying values as polyline charts or heatmaps; however, both type of techniques are difficult to simultaneously observe short-term features of time-varying values and cluster transitions. This poster proposes storyline-based visualization technique for consecutive numerical time-varying data. Storyline is a visualization technique to show associative feature among elements over time. Our technique measures similarity of each elements and draw similar elements as proximity storyline. The technique also reflects differential values on storyline as a visual variable to emphasize the amount of line changes.

Title: Data Analysis Tool for Arm Movement Pattern in Virtual Catching Task: A Preliminary Development

Abstract: This paper describes the development of our virtual reality based rehabilitation system for children with cerebral palsy (CP). This system was designed to facilitate intrinsic motivation of CP patients for a rehabilitation exercise by integrating a gamification framework. In a previous study, we identified patient's strategy changes during the rehabilitation task involving catching. The aim of this study is to develop a data-mining framework that utilizes results from the previous study coupled with real-time visualization and data generation to further the understanding of the strategy changes during the catching task. In this paper, we describe a result of a preliminary development of the proposed framework.

Title: A Visual Approach to Detecting Drive-by Download Attacks

Abstract: Drive-by Download(DbD) attack is one of malware infection schemes that pose a major threat to users on the Internet. The attack tends to go unnoticed by users, because, upon infection, there is almost no visible change to the screen or the computer. Moreover, infections can occur merely as a result of a user visiting a web page. The conventional approach to DbD attacks is to use anti-virus(AV) software to detect malware. However, this approach is limited, because AV software does not always correctly detect emerging malware. Therefore, we designed a network-communication visualization system to assist in the detection of DbD attacks. We expect that the proposed visualization system will successfully give an awareness to users of suspicious software downloads.

Title: Logo Trend Visualization: Logo Design Shape Element Trend and Pattern Analysis

Abstract: Logo, as a way to represent the identity of a company brand, is an essential design to deliver the value and meaning of the company. A design shape trend is necessary to read and predict the fast-moving global market environment, in order to design a competitive logo. This study thus created `Logo trend visualization', which is a combination of Radviz and Circle parallel coordinate to provide a guideline to design a competitive logo, based on such background. As a consequence, we suggest that design shape elements such as transformation to surface, overlapping, artificiality, concept of color and rhythm should be emphasized, and that logo trend visualization facilitates the understanding of the trend of a logo, based on the addition (or elimination) of various design shape elements which accordingly creates a new trend.

Title: Enhanced Visualization of News Shot Cloud with Employing Circular Layout

Abstract: TV news programs are one of major information sources for daily lives. Since the computer storage cost has reduced significantly, today we can digitally archive a huge amount of TV news programs. On the other hand, as the archive size grows larger, the cost for browsing and utilizing news video archives also increases significantly. To circumvent this problem, we devised a visualization method called "News Shot Cloud" in our former work. The news shot cloud displays TV news shots in the similar manner with the tag clouds. In this poster, we present an enhancement method of the news shot cloud by modifying the thumbnail layout from the conventional linear layout to the circular. The design and the advantages of the new layout are shown with experimental implementation. The new layout is more helpful to identify informative news shots rapidly, and at the same time, it also helps users to examine less-weighted news shots to find lower-ranked but unexpectedly informative ones.

Title: Using Virtual Reality Technique to Enhance Experience of Exploring 3D Trajectory Visualizations

Abstract: Trajectory data visualizations are usually 3-Dimensional. Due to the potential cluttering and occlusion problems, slow speed and poor interactivity as well as the influence of perspective to the effects of display, 3D visualization techniques have been controversial in the field of information visualization. To address these problems, this paper proposes a novel 3D trajectory visualization method employing the immersive virtual reality technology. Compared with the traditional 3D trajectory visualization methods, our method breaks the limitations of the traditional 2D display of 3D visualization, and engages users in a virtual world with optional perspective to observe 3D visualization without over-plotting. Through practical experiments, our work can reduce the over-plotting of 3D visualization results, and provide smooth transition between visualization views and interactions.

Title: A fast and slippery slope for file systems

Abstract: There is a vast number and variety of file systems currently available, each optimizing for an ever growing number of storage devices and workloads. Users have an unprecedented, and somewhat overwhelming, number of data management options. At the same time, the fastest storage devices are only getting faster, and it is unclear on how well the existing file systems will adapt. Using emulation techniques, we evaluate five popular Linux file systems across a range of storage device latencies typical to low-end hard drives, latest high-performance persistent memory block devices, and in between. Our findings are often surprising. Depending on the workload, we find that some file systems can clearly scale with faster storage devices much better than others. Further, as storage device latency decreases, we find unexpected performance inversions across file systems. Finally, file system scalability in the higher device latency range is not representative of scalability in the lower, sub-millisecond, latency range. We then focus on Nilfs2 as an especially alarming example of an unexpectedly poor scalability and present detailed instructions for identifying bottlenecks in the I/O stack.

Title: Revisiting hash table design for phase change memory

Abstract: Phase Change Memory (PCM) is emerging as an attractive alternative to Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) in building data-intensive computing systems. PCM offers read/write performance asymmetry that makes it necessary to revisit the design of in-memory applications.In this paper, we focus on in-memory hash tables, a family of data structures with wide applicability. We evaluate several popular hash-table designs to understand their performance under PCM. We find that for write-heavy workloads the designs that achieve best performance for PCMdiffer from the ones that are best for DRAM, and that designs achieving a high load factor also cause a high number of memory writes. Finally, we propose PFHT, a PCM-Friendly Hash Table which presents a cuckoo hashing variant that is tailored to PCM characteristics, and offers a better trade-off between performance, the amount of writes generated, and the expected load factor than any of the existing DRAM-based implementations.

Title: Androtrace: framework for tracing and analyzing IOs on Android

Abstract: In this work, we develop IO trace and analysis framework, Androtrace, which is specifically tailored for Android platform. Unlike earlier works that required prolonged post processing procedures, Androtrace not only traces with low overhead, but also provides efficient solution for storage with--in mobile devices. Captured IO trace is temporarily stored in main memory and storage device, and they are transferred to Androtrace server when the device is connected to WiFi. We use server and client model to support and analyze multiple Android users. Using the framework, we find that write IOs are dominant in mobile workload.

Title: Mjölnir: collecting trash in a demanding new world

Abstract: As flash devices become ubiquitous in data centers and cost per gigabyte drops, flash systems need to provide data services similar to those of traditional storage. We present Mjölnir, a powerful and scalable engine that addresses the core problems that make efficient flash based data services challenging: multi-reference management and garbage collection. Additionally, by providing powerful primitives for address remapping, Mjölnir enables redesign of the I/O stack for greater efficiency and performance with flash. Mjölnir uses techniques from language runtimes for reference management and garbage collection; we show via prototype and experimental evaluation that this design can deliver predictable performance even with varied user workloads across a range of capacity and reference-count scales.

Title: Comparing Graph Layouts for Vertex Selection Tasks

Abstract: Different graph layouts can affect a user's ability to complete both passive understanding and active interaction tasks. While most research exploring the effects of graph layout looks at a user's ability to accomplish a passive understanding task, this paper's novel contribution is looking at their ability to complete a selection task. Specifically we compare two graph layout algorithms with respect to their suitability for free-form multi-selection.The two layout algorithms are drawn from our previous work which established that they have significantly different understandability metric scores. A motivation for this choice was to explore whether graphs with significantly different metric scores will also have significantly different performance for selection tasks. We carried out our comparison by means of a user experiment that followed a within-subjects design, where 74 users were given a PlayStation Move controller to select vertices in 20 pairs of graphs. We found that while there was no difference in the speed of interaction there was a difference in the number of errors users made between the two layout algorithms.

Title: Towards software defined persistent memory: rethinking software support for heterogenous memory architectures

Abstract: The emergence of persistent memories promises a sea-change in application and data center architectures, with efficiencies and performance not possible with today's volatile DRAM and persistent slow storage. We present Software Defined Persistent Memory, an approach that enables applications to use persistent memory in a variety of local and remote configurations. The heterogeneity is managed by a middleware that manages hardware specific needs and optimizations. We present the first ever design and implementation of such an architecture, and illustrate the key abstractions that are needed to hide hardware specific details from applications while exposing necessary characteristics for performance optimization. We evaluate the performance of our implementation on a set of microbenchmarks and database workloads using the MySQL database. Through our evaluation, we show that it is possible to apply Software Defined concepts to persistent memory, to improve performance while retaining functionality and optimizing for different hardware architectures.

Title: Evaluating Low-cost Activity Trackers for Use in Large-scale Data Gathering of Forestry Workers

Abstract: The New Zealand forestry industry has the country's highest rate of workplace fatalities, the reasons for which are not welrichardl studied or understood. We believe the first step in identifying any successful solution is to develop a fine-grained understanding of the physical context of forestry work by performing large-scale data collection of the levels of physical activity the workers engage in as well as their sleep patterns over extended periods of time. Our goal is to use lightweight, wearable technology (so-called activity trackers) to collect this data. In order to do so we need a clear understanding of the capabilities and limitations of such devices, both in general and in the proposed use environment for forestry workers. In this paper we present the results of user studies and comparisons of six activity trackers and three mobile phone applications used to track activity and sleep. We also discuss our initial pilot study with forestry workers and discuss the problems encountered using the trackers in the environment.

Title: Exploiting NVM in large-scale graph analytics

Abstract: Data center applications like graph analytics require servers with ever larger memory capacities. DRAM scaling, however, is not able to match the increasing demands for capacity. Emerging byte-addressable, non-volatile memory technologies (NVM) offer a more scalable alternative, with memory that is directly addressable to software, but at a higher latency and lower bandwidth.Using an NVM hardware emulator, we study the suitability of NVM in meeting the memory demands of four state of the art graph analytics frameworks, namely Graphlab, Galois, X-Stream and Graphmat. We evaluate their performance with popular algorithms (Pagerank, BFS, Triangle Counting and Collaborative filtering) by allocating memory exclusive from DRAM (DRAM-only) or emulated NVM (NVM-only).While all of these applications are sensitive to higher latency or lower bandwidth of NVM, resulting in performance degradation of up to 4x with NVM-only (compared to DRAM-only), we show that the performance impact is somewhat mitigated in the frameworks that exploit CPU memory-level parallelism and hardware prefetchers.Further, we demonstrate that, in a hybrid memory system with NVM and DRAM, intelligent placement of application data based on their relative importance may help offset the overheads of the NVM-only solution in a cost-effective manner (i.e., using only a small amount of DRAM). Specifically, we show that, depending on the algorithm, Graphmat can achieve close to DRAM-only performance (within 1.2x) by placing only 6.7% to 31.5% of its total memory footprint in DRAM.

Title: In Bed with Technology: Challenges and Opportunities for Sleep Tracking

Abstract: In recent years a variety of mobile apps, wearable technologies and embedded systems have emerged that allow individuals to track the amount and the quality of their sleep in their own beds. Despite the widespread adoption of these technologies, little is known about the challenges that current users face in tracking and analysing their sleep. Hence we conducted a qualitative study to examine the practices of current users of sleep tracking technologies and to identify challenges in current practice. Based on data collected from 5 online forums for users of sleep-tracking technologies, we identified 22 different challenges under the following 4 themes: tracking continuity, trust, data manipulation, and data interpretation. Based on these results, we propose 6 design opportunities to assist researchers and practitioners in designing sleep-tracking technologies.

Title: A Non-Linear Regression Model to Predict Aesthetic Ratings of On-Screen Images

Abstract: It has been found that the perceived appeal (or aesthetic) of an interface plays important role in determining its usability. Predictive model of interface aesthetics can thus be useful for designer to determine and improve usability. Images being an integral part of most of the interfaces contribute significantly to the overall interface aesthetics. In this paper, we propose a computational model to predict the aesthetic quality of on-screen images. We have identified a total of twenty features, divided into two broad categories, to capture image aesthetics. In order to relate the features to aesthetics, we performed a controlled user study with eighty images and hundred participants. The images were created by us and the participants were asked to rate those on a 5-point scale as per their judgment of appeal (or beauty or aesthetics) of the images. The data were used to train and test a non-linear regression model based on a SVM classifier, as the predictor of image aesthetics, with a mean square error of 0.03. The model basically predicts the likely aesthetic rating (on a 5-point scale) for a given image, given the feature values. The proposed model along with the details of the empirical data collection and analysis are discussed in this paper.

Title: keyValuate: A Framework for Rapid Evaluation of Adaptive Keyboards on Touchscreens

Abstract: We propose a general-purpose framework for the implementation and evaluation of adaptive virtual keyboards based on unprocessed sensory information from an interactive surface. We furthermore describe an implementation on a commercially available optical touchscreen that features real-time visualization of the underlying key classification process. The typing application, which uses support vector machine classifiers and bivariate Gaussian distributions to differentiate between keys, was evaluated in a user study with 24 participants. The adaptive keyboard performed significantly better in terms of typing speed and error rates compared to a standard onscreen keyboard (approximately 40% speedup and 25% reduced error rates). We also performed evaluations with reduced sensor resolutions and additive noise in order to verify the generalizability of the presented approach for other sensing techniques. Our approach showed high robustness in both conditions. Based on these findings, we discuss possible implications for future implementations of virtual keyboards.

Title: Effects of paper on cross-reference reading for multiple documents: Comparison of reading performances and processes between paper and computer displays

Abstract: This paper describes two experiments that compare paper and computer displays in cross-reference reading for multiple documents. The first experiment quantitatively showed the superiority of paper regarding reading speed and error-detection rate. To investigate the reason for this, in the second experiment, we microscopically analyzed the process of reading, focusing on users' interaction with documents. Results showed that pointing to text is frequently performed and takes less time moving documents horizontally when using paper. Considering the results, we discuss methodologies to improve electronic reading devices.

Title: Fostering Collaboration in the Management of Family Finances

Abstract: Managing finances is a practice carried out daily in homes across the world. Despite this, the practice is not yet a strong focus for HCI work in the home. This paper looks specifically at the ways that families organise and manage their finances. Based on a process of in-situ qualitative interviews, we find that money management is often a collaborative process in the family and occurs in a similar way to other household tasks; as part of existing divisions of domestic labour. Participating families reflected upon the creative and often low-tech systems they used to manage their finances and ideas they had for "ideal" technologies that would better help them organise their money. This paper presents ideas for fostering collaboration around family finances. Design propositions are made towards a Family Holiday Expense Tracker and family-situated bill payment reminder, both of which aim to encourage whole-of-family collaboration around money management and better including children in what is, at-present, an activity they are largely excluded from.

Title: Page Navigation on Paper Books and Electronic Media in Reading to Answer Questions

Abstract: This paper describes experiments comparing reading performance such as reading speed and the accuracy of tasks in reading to answer questions using different media: paper books, a desktop PC, and a tablet PC. As typical examples of reading of this kind, we considered two scenarios: searching answers from text manuals and searching given photographs from photo books. In two experiments conducted according to the two scenarios, participants performed tasks most quickly using a paper book or a PC. They had trouble flipping through pages with a tablet PC. Although the paper book was inferior to the PC in terms of turning over pages continuously with rapidity, participants performed flexible navigation with the paper book such as starting the navigation from various positions of the book and jumping to the target position straight away without hesitating skipping over the target. Based on these results, we provide suggestions to improve a page navigation feature in electronic media.

Title: VibRein: An Engaging and Assistive Mobile Learning Companion for Students with Intellectual Disabilities

Abstract: Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have paved a new wave in the education world. Rich multimedia content coupled with mobile delivery mechanisms makes the content always available and engaging. This paper proposes VibRein to enrich the student interaction with multimedia learning content by making use of different sensors that are available on a mobile device to create an intelligent video consumption experience. VibRein as a companion is even more effective for students with intellectual disabilities who require some form of continuous supervision. It provides an assistive mechanism that keeps track of the user attention using the device camera (this can be particularly useful for students with attention disorder), and uses haptic feedback to recapture attention. In course of the video consumption, VibRein evaluates the learning by asking questions about the content in the video, and automatically force-rewinds to the location where the concept was explained if the user answers incorrectly. It uses tilt in four directions for response to questions, since touch, as a modality on mobile devices requires fine motor skills. An evaluation with 18 users with intellectual disabilities of various kind (autism, intellectual disability and attention deficit hyperactive disorder) suggests that VibRein can provide better learning with less intervention.

Title: Understanding and Comparing Smartphone and Tablet Use: Insights from a Large-Scale Diary Study

Abstract: In recent years, smartphone and tablet ownership has shown continued growth; however, there is a lack of research thoroughly investigating the use of these devices within the general public. This paper describes a large-scale diary study with U. S. mobile device owners, examining details of smartphone and tablet use. Results provide a comprehensive breakdown of frequent activities and contexts of use, highlighting key differences in smartphone and tablet use. Activities on smartphones were found to be dominated by communication needs, while tablets were frequently used for consumption and entertainment. Both devices were most often used at home, with tablets rarely leaving the home. Within the home, smartphones were used mostly in the bedroom, and tablets in the living room. Both devices were used frequently while doing something else, such as using tablets primarily while watching TV. Conclusions discuss implications for enriching the experience of mobile devices and opportunities for future research.

Title: Evanescent Adaptation on Small Screens

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of mastering the complexity of interacting with a large set of applications on smartphones. In one hand, number of applications increases. In the other hand, screen size reduces. To tackle this paradoxical evolution, we investigate adaptive user interfaces. We assume that it is possible to predict the applications of interest for a user in a given situation. Based on this hypothesis, our challenge is to accelerate user interaction when prediction is correct, without penalizing it when prediction is wrong. The paper proposes the concept of Evanescent Adaptation. The principle is a two-layer based representation: the predicted items (first layer) are displayed above the full list of items (second layer). The first layer is said to be evanescent in the sense that it automatically disappears progressively. The paper claims for putting this disappearing process under the control of the end-user. Thereby the user can close the first-layer as soon as s/he perceives prediction as irrelevant.

Title: Adapting a Soft 2.5D Actuated Shape Display for Rebound Tenderness Simulation and Training

Abstract: This paper presents our work towards adapting ForceForm, a 2.5D actuated surface, for use as a medical training apparatus for rebound tenderness, an application area which lacks prior research from computing researchers. Rebound tenderness is used by health practitioners to physically examine a patient's abdomen by applying and then releasing pressure with the hands. This paper demonstrates a novel technique to allow an actuated shape display to detect interactions caused by the user pressing down upon a soft surface by means of a Hall effect sensor. User evaluation of the interaction reveals that the further the user is required to press down into the surface, the more accurately the task is performed when visual cues are present, but the relationship between accuracy and depth is inverted when users are required to perform a depth recall task without the presence of visual cues. The results of this research support the continued development of ForceForm for rebound tenderness simulations and suggest that unexpected user performance patterns may occur when utilising soft interfaces.

Title: Can SAL Support Self Reflection for Health and Nutrition?

Abstract: Important long-term goals for good health and wellbeing are challenging to achieve. Emerging technology offers the promise of easy data collection to help people monitor progress toward such goals. We designed SAL (simple, situated ambient logger) to help people track food eaten. It is minimalist with a core goal of making it easy for people to log progress towards goals, in particular, diet goals. We recruited ten participants who used SAL food loggers over 2 weeks. Our analysis of SAL use and interviews indicates it is usable and supports reflection on food intake. Our key contributions are insights into the potential of, and future directions of SAL loggers.

Title: Investigating User Confidence for Uncertainty Presentation in Predictive Decision Making

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) based decision support systems are often like a black box to non-expert users. Here user's confidence becomes critical for effective decision making and maintaining trust in the system. We find that user confidence varies significantly depending on supplementary material presented on screen. We investigate change in user confidence (in the context of ML based decision making) by varying level of uncertainty presented (in an online water-pipe failure prediction case study) and find that all 26 subjects rated higher uncertainty task to be most difficult and had lowest user confidence in predictive decisions of the same. This agrees with our expectation that increased uncertainty would reduce user confidence in predictive decision making. However, ML-researchers subgroup reported being most confident when uncertainty with known probability was presented, whereas other subgroups (viz. general staff and non-ML researchers) appeared most confident when uncertainty was not at all presented. This is an original research to improve understanding of user's decision making confidence with respect to uncertainty presented in machine learning context.

Title: Domain Exploration of ICT Use in Consumer-to-Producer Feedback Loops within the Fair Trade System

Abstract: Information and communications technology (ICT) plays an important role in facilitating information flows through fair trade supply chains. While previous research has focused on the role of ICT in providing consumers with fair trade producer information, few studies have considered the operation of feedback loops from consumers to producers, particularly in an Australian context. This qualitative study provides a novel contribution in this area through a domain exploration of the consumer-to-producer feedback loops in the fair trade system and the role of ICT in facilitating these supply chain communications. We have used ethnographic techniques through semi-structured interviews with consumer, importer, and producer links in the supply chain, analysing and refining our data using a grounded-theory approach. The discussion engages with emerging themes addressing the actual information needs of producers, attributes of existing feedback loops, and the role of ICT in fair trade handicraft supply chains. We explore the function of intermediaries in the supply chains who aggregate, filter and interpret feedback that flows from the consumers and importers through to the producer organisations and the artisans who produce the goods. Finally, we consider potential future applications of ICT to fair trade feedback loops and associated design sensitivities to ensure that feedback offered by consumers and importers satisfies producer information needs, establishing new avenues of enquiry in the field of HCI for Development (HCI4D).

Title: Facilitating Flexible Electricity Use in the Home with Eco-Feedback and Eco-Forecasting

Abstract: Over the last decade there has been an increased focus on changing domestic electricity consumption behaviors. While the usual approach has been to facilitate reduced consumption, recent work has started looking at facilitating more flexible electricity use as a means of shifting consumption to more favorable times. This approach means that people may behave more sustainably without necessarily using less electricity. Exploring this emerging approach, this paper presents a study of flexibility in domestic electricity use as facilitated by an eco-feedback system with forecast information about price, availability of green energy, and grid demand. The prototype system was deployed in three households for 22 weeks. Our findings show that flexible electricity use is far from trivial to achieve in domestic households. The details of this is relevant for understanding people's ability and willingness to shift electricity consumption, and for the design of systems that facilitate doing this.

Title: Designing a health screening tool to help young people communicate with their general practitioner

Abstract: Adolescence is an important developmental period for physical, cognitive, social and emotional development when a wide range of health problems and risky health-related behaviours may emerge and co-occur. General Practitioners (GPs) are ideally positioned to deliver preventive health and early intervention as part of young people's routine health care. A quick and effective way for GPs to identify areas of concern is through technology-based health screening tools, which are acceptable to young people and facilitate self-disclosure about sensitive topics. Despite these advantages, the rate of using this technology remains low. This is the first study that involves all end users and stakeholders in the design of a health screening technology for young people in general practice settings. Our rich findings on the design needs and concerns of young people, GPs, practice staff and parents regarding technologies for health communication will be useful to any researchers and practitioners designing health technologies in a general practice setting.

Title: Help Me Keep My Stuff Safe: Designing a Collaborative Online Repository for Young People in Care

Abstract: Managing the personal information and possessions of young people in out of home care presents unique challenges. Photos, documents and mementos are easily lost or left behind at changes of care placement. Lack of access to such personal artefacts negatively impacts care decisions, identity construction and social relationships. Prior work identified the potential for an online repository (a 'virtual locker') to manage personal materials in this context.This research examines tensions related to privacy and control that impact on the design of the virtual locker. Through workshops conducted with young care leavers and social workers we derived design objectives and, based on these, we propose mechanisms for resolving the tensions identified. Informed by user evaluation of a 'virtual locker' prototype, we develop heuristics for design of personal content systems in shifting social contexts. In this work, we identify the need for personal control of content, balanced governance and flexible collaboration tools. These heuristics and associated insights contribute to theoretical and design work related to personal and social content systems.

Title: Digital Pop-Up: Investigating Bespoke Community Engagement in Public Spaces

Abstract: This paper presents findings from a series of iterative field studies on the use of interactive, situated digital technologies deployed within a pop-up style format used for the purpose of community engagement. Based on observations, participant interviews, and a focus group with representatives from the local government authority, the contribution of this research is twofold. First, we propose five elements to guide the design of digital pop-up interventions for community engagement. Second, we demonstrate the effectiveness of combining digital interfaces and a physical pop-up within a civic space equipped with a large urban screen to engage wider cross-sections of the public. From that, we derive insights about the utilisation of this approach in attracting the attention of people who do not generally attend traditional community engagement events, and provide a more seamless consultation process by enabling citizens to submit their responses on the spot.

Title: Do We Ruin the Moment? Exploring the Design of Novel Capturing Technologies

Abstract: By capturing our experiences we often strive to better remember them in the future. However, the act of media capturing also influences these same experiences in the present, an area which is underexplored. This paper describes a study with the aim to inform the design of novel media capturing strategies. Adopting an approach of defamiliarization based on intervention and reflection, we strive to gain insights in the influences of future capturing technologies on the experience of a day out. We conducted an exploratory study in which 28 students went on a day out and used a variety of capturing strategies. Individual and group reflections on the experience during this day identified several important aspects that media capturing influences: engagement, perception & attention and social activity. The paper concludes with implications for design and proposes three potential future directions for media capturing, that instead of disturbing the moment enhance the experience.

Title: TrainYarn: Probing Perceptions of Social Space in Urban Commuter Trains

Abstract: We studied the ways that urban commuter train passengers experience their journeys. We present the design process and in-situ evaluation of TrainYarn, a mobile app prototype designed to facilitate social interaction between co-located urban train passengers. Through the deployment of the prototype, we sought to probe perceptions of social space with a view to positively impact the assessment of public transport. Our results support that our target users saw value in the use of TrainYarn, perceiving it as emancipatory, in alignment with their communicative needs, and having the ability to transform their perceptions of social space. To further inform future research and practice, we put forward a series of design recommendations.

Title: The Fuzzy Front End of Experience Design: Eliciting and Communicating Experience Goals

Abstract: When starting an experience design process, designers should first determine the experience to aim for. In the fuzzy front end of the experience design process, there are often several alternative sources for gaining insight and inspiration in defining this experience. In this paper, we describe our findings from two surveys about experience goal setting and approaches to communicate about these goals with stakeholders. The results from researchers working on 9 different experience design cases suggest that "empathic understanding of the users' world" is the most used source of insight and inspiration in defining experience goals. As an end result, we propose the model for Experience Goal Elicitation Process to clarify the fuzzy front end of experience design and instructions to support designers in defining and evaluating experience goals.

Title: Visual Distractions Effects on Reading in Digital Environments: A Comparison of First and Second English Language Readers

Abstract: Reading in digital environments can be very distracting. Using eye-tracking technology, we investigate if text readability affects distraction rate, eye movements, and reading comprehension in a visually distracting digital environment. We compared an easy-to-read text and a hard-to-read text on both first language English (L1) readers and second language English (L2) readers. Text readability was measured using the standard readability formulas such as the Flesch-Kincaid Grade level. Results show that text readability does cause different eye movements and produce reading comprehension results that deviate from what is normally expected. Readers are affected more by the distractions when reading easy-to-read text compared to when reading hard-to-read text. Furthermore, L2 readers are affected more than L1 readers. These findings can be used in the design of eLearning materials when distractions cannot be overcome.

Title: Investigating Cross-Device Interaction Techniques: A Case of Card Playing on Handhelds and Tablets

Abstract: Cross-device interaction is getting more and more common as mobile and handheld technologies surround us in almost every situation and context. HCI research has started to study various aspects of cross-device interaction including application areas and techniques, but we still need further studies on opportunities. We illustrate six cross-device interaction techniques. Using two different prototype systems that implement them for a card-playing context we evaluate them in two studies on usability and usefulness. Our findings suggest that some techniques were fast to perform (touch-and-hold and tap-tap) and some had a high number of errors (swipe). Also, our participants would sometimes mix up the techniques and make a wrong action while playing the game. Finally, we discuss and illustrate issues of cross-device interaction consistency and division of shared and personal devices.

Title: A Perspective of Games for People with Physical Disabilities

Abstract: People with physical disabilities have to handle obstacles to conduct their lives. In Digital Games Development and Natural User Interface (NUI), researchers have shown interest in overcoming these obstacles. In this study, we collected data to evaluate how they are conducting their studies. We gathered 1485 articles from scientific databases and selected 93, from which we extracted information regarding the contribution of each study, the users responses to each approach, intervention tools and other topics. Our conclusion presents a perspective of studies of games focusing on the rehabilitation and accessibility of people with physical disabilities, a guideline with considerations of the researchers in the field and our suggested directions for new studies.

Title: Down the Superhighway in a Single Tome: Examining the Impact of Book Format on Borrowing Interactions

Abstract: Many readers claim that the uptake of ebooks by libraries hampers their information seeking by not affording them the opportunity to browse. Conversely, readers value the convenience of anywhere-anytime access offered by ebooks. This paper aims to examine the impact of book format on borrowing patterns across a book collection. We do this by comparing usage in print and ebook collections from the same library, thus ensuring the same user population and the same discovery system. We discover a number of key differences, including borrowing frequency and number of books borrowed on a single occasion.

Title: HCI Methods for Empowering Discussion on Person-Centered Fall Prevention with Older Adults

Abstract: This paper contends that Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) methods have the potential to improve person-centered fall prevention for older adults. One-size-fits-all solutions are not appropriate for everybody, and a considered, individualised approach to fall prevention is needed. A qualitative content analysis of sixty community based falls risk assessment forms and person-centered care documents was conducted. The results presented provide insights into the care goals of older adults as well as various reasons underpinning low acceptance and compliance with fall preventative home modifications and assistive technologies. These interventions are based on the goals of older adults that commonly extend beyond compensatory approaches to improve physical performance within the home environment. HCI methods and new technologies provide an opportunity to reshape person-centered fall prevention, resulting in higher satisfaction and subsequent compliance rates amongst older adults. Furthermore, a series of HCI inspired person-centered design guidelines for designing home modifications and assistive technologies solutions are presented.

Title: Ad hoc Communities on the Road: Serendipitous Social Encounters to Enhance Tourist Experiences

Abstract: Driving can be a lonely activity. While there has been a lot of research and technical inventions concerning car-to-car communication and passenger entertainment, there is still little work concerning connecting drivers. Whereas tourism is very much a social activity, drive tourists and road trippers have few options to communicate with fellow travelers. Our study is placed at the intersection of tourism and driving. It aims to enhance the trip experience during driving through social interaction. This paper explores how a mobile application that allows instant messaging between travelers sharing similar context can establish a temporary, ad hoc community and enhance the road trip experience. A prototype was developed and evaluated in various user and field studies. The study's outcomes are relevant for the design of future mobile tourist guides that benefit from community design, social encounters and recommendations.

Title: From Users to Citizens: Some Thoughts on Designing for Polity and Civics

Abstract: This paper presents an essay aimed at prompting broad discussion crucial in keeping the interaction design discourse fresh, critical, and in motion. We trace the changing role of people who have advanced from consumers to producers, from stationary office workers to mobile urban nomads, from passive members of the plebs to active instigators of change. Yet, interaction designers often still refer to them only as 'users.' We follow some of the historic developments from the information superhighway to the smart city in order to provide the backdrop in front of which we critically analyse three core areas. First, the issue of echo chambers and filter bubbles in social media results in a political polarisation that jeopardises the formation of a functioning public sphere. Second, pretty lights and colourful façades in media architecture are increasingly making way for situated installations and interventions fostering community engagement. And third, civic activism is often reduced to forms of slacktivism. We synthesise our discussion to propose 'citizen-ability' as an alternative goal for interaction designers to aspire to in order to create new polities and civics for a better quality of life.

Title: Beyond YouTube: Sharing Personal Digital Stories on a Community Display

Abstract: Video-sharing sites such as YouTube and Vimeo have been used to share videos that describe difficult life experiences, and provide a forum for people living with adversity to express themselves and connect with others. This may not benefit those who require support in building local connections, however, as audiences are unknown and may not be supportive of content. In this paper we present findings from a project that investigated how creating and sharing digital stories in local community settings could help build a sense of connection for those who are housebound and unable to participate in community activities. This paper outlines two interlinked studies. Study One describes an analysis of online videos shared by housebound people. This informed Study Two, which involved creating digital stories with participants, and developing an interactive display to share the stories at a local community event. This paper contributes insights into the opportunities and challenges of using a community display for sharing personal digital stories.

Title: Understanding Video based Parent Training Intervention for Children with Autism

Abstract: This paper investigates the challenges of delivering parent training intervention for autism over video. We conducted a qualitative field study of an intervention, which is based on a well-established training program for parents of children with autism, called Hanen More Than Words. The study was conducted with a Hanen Certified speech pathologist who delivered video based training to two mothers, each with a son having autism. We conducted observations of 14 sessions of the intervention spanning 3 months along with 3 semi-structured interviews with each participant. We identified different activities that participants performed across different sessions and analysed them based upon their implications on technology. We found that all the participants welcomed video based training but they also faced several difficulties, particularly in establishing rapport with other participants, inviting equal participation, and in observing and providing feedback on parent-child interactions. Finally, we reflect on our findings and motivate further investigations by defining three design sensitivities of Adaptation, Group Participation, and Physical Setup.

Title: Better Health Explorer: Designing for Health Information Seekers

Abstract: A vast amount of health information has been published online, yet users often report difficulties in locating information in this particular domain. Based on our prior research, we consider four categories of online health information seekers who demonstrate mixed information needs. Although their searching needs are often well satisfied by entering keywords into search engines, their need to explore information is not so well supported, thus affecting their user experience and satisfaction. In this paper, we propose design principles for supporting the exploration of online health information. We present the rationale and the design process of a web app -- Better Health Explorer -- which is a proof-of-concept app tailored to health information exploration. This work contributes to the design of online health information systems as well as exploratory systems in general.

Title: The Challenge of Technology Research in Sensitive Settings: Case Studies in 'ensitive HCI'

Abstract: A growing proportion of human-computer interaction research now takes place in sensitive settings with participants who might be considered vulnerable, such as the chronically ill, older adults, and people living with mental health issues. Alongside this move into complex "real life" settings there is growing interest in the ethical challenges HCI researchers encounter, the emotional impact research can have on participants and researchers, and the risk that new technologies might exacerbate, rather than ameliorate, existing vulnerabilities. Some authors have called for researchers to openly reflect about ethical challenges so we can learn from shared experiences. Others have warned that HCI researchers may not be sufficiently equipped to understand and respond to the needs of vulnerable participants. This paper documents cases of "sensitive HCI," drawing on research conducted in diverse sensitive settings. By reflecting on common challenges and discussing possible responses we contribute to growing discourse that promotes reflexive practice in sensitive HCI.

Title: A Non-linear Mapping Technique for Bare-hand Interaction in Large Virtual Environments

Abstract: Computer vision-based bare-hand tracking systems have become popular as they free the users from wearing any hardware devices (e.g. gloves). However, due to the limitations in tracking methods and human body constraints, interaction methods developed for other 3D interaction devices can have problems when applied to computer vision-based bare-hand tracking systems. Therefore, there is a need to develop interaction techniques suitable for bare-hand input. In this paper we investigate a non-linear mapping technique for bare-hand input in large-scale virtual environments based on physiological constraints. This method not only enables high precision interaction with objects at both near and far distances, but also allows users to manipulate objects efficiently with significant translation and rotation. Through a user study, we show that the proposed method can be fairly effective, precise, more usable, and less stressful compared to two more traditional baseline interaction techniques

Title: TUI-Geometry: A Tangible User Interface for Geometric Drawing on an Interactive Tabletop

Abstract: Physical drawing tools, such as rulers, afford immediate visual and proprioceptive feedback to the user: even before a line is added to the drawing. Such immediacy is not available in standard digital drawing software. We introduce TUI-Geometry, a drawing application that senses tangible drawing tools on an interactive tabletop and provides the user with intelligent visual feedback and drawing beautification. A user evaluation comparing TUI-Geometry to an application with passive tools showed that users preferred TUI-Geometry and were able to draw significantly more accurately with it -- thus we provide the foundation for intelligent instructional support of geometry construction with tangibles.

Title: Where is the "I" in iPad?: The Role of Interest in Older Adults' Learning of Mobile Touch Screen Technologies

Abstract: This research explores the role of individual interest in the adoption of mobile touch screen technologies by older adults (above 60 years of age), based on the Four-Phase Model of Interest Development by Hidi and Renninger (2006) and Self-Determination Theory (SDT) by Deci and Ryan (1985). A twelve-week study consisting of observations and interviews with teachers and participants in short course classes was conducted, during which we investigated the specific interests of older adults. Specifically, we explored the influence of individuals' level of interest on their learning and use of technologies. The engagement of 35 participants across four short course classes was compared both with and without the use of mobile touch screen technologies. Results show that there is a close relationship between individual interest and uptake of mobile touch screen technologies. This research aims to investigate how individual interest in a domain can engender and maintain engagement with technology learning and use by older adults.

Title: Differentiated Participation in Social Videogaming

Abstract: Social videogaming provides opportunities for individuals not only to engage directly in active gameplay but also to interact indirectly from the sidelines. We present a study of the differentiated nature of participation in gaming based on field observations of six families playing physical videogames in their homes. Building on existing theoretical frameworks, we distinguish three kinds of durable roles: players, audience members and bystanders. Going beyond this, we also identify a rich variety of spontaneous and ephemeral roles among the audience: spectators, orchestrators, managers, coaches, directors, puppeteers, commentators, hecklers, supporters, documenters, shadow players, and cheerleaders. We argue that through this richer understanding of the differentiated nature of participation in videogaming, designers might expand the reach of their games and respond to the potential for new experiences in the broad situation of domestic gaming.

Title: Remote Gaze and Gesture Tracking on the Microsoft Kinect: Investigating the Role of Feedback

Abstract: In this paper we present the results of a user experience and preference study into the combination of gaze and gesture in a lounge-style remote-interaction, using a novel system that tracks gaze and gesture using only the Kinect device at a distance of 2m from the user. Our results indicate exciting opportunities for gaze-tracking interfaces that use existing technologies, but suggest that findings from studies of highly-accurate gaze systems may not apply in these real-world simulations where the gaze-tracking is inherently less accurate. We contribute a series of design recommendations for gaze and gesture interfaces in this context, and based on these limitations.

Title: Trialling the use of Tablets in Australian Courts: The Jury is Still Out...

Abstract: Australian Courtrooms are presently under pressure to adopt suitable technologies for evidence presentation in the courtrooms. This decision is to alleviate reliance on increasing volumes of paper based evidence documentation, harness the value of streamlining evidence presentation, reduce the time of trials and consequently increase courtroom availability. This paper discusses the findings of two ethnographic studies of court trial simulation activities held in the County Courts of both NSW and Victoria, where members of the Australian judiciary, including judges, barristers, lawyers, court administrators and law academics participated in criminal trial simulations where all of the evidence was presented with the use of tablet technology. This required the professional members of the judiciary to role-play as jury members, plaintiff, judge, the witness and courtroom administration. The purpose of the study was to demonstrate the capability of tablet technologies in the courtroom to the members of the judiciary community while identifying the requirements and wants of the participants, in order to produce a series of design recommendations for future development. It was found that there were substantially more advantages than just paper saving and reduced time produced from the introduction of technology as well as areas of concern for the judiciary.

Title: Pairing Technology and Meals: A Contextual Enquiry in the Family Household

Abstract: Recent research about technology during mealtime has been mostly concerned with developing technology rather than creating a deeper understanding of the context of family mealtimes and associated practices. In this paper, we present a two-phase study discussing how the temporal, social, and food related features are intertwined with technology use during mealtimes. Our findings show how people differentiate technology usage during weekday meals, weekend meals, and among different meals of the day. We identify and analyse prototypical situations ranging from the use of arbitrary technologies while eating solitary, to idiosyncratic family norms and practices associated with shared technologies. We discuss the use of mealtime technology to create appropriate ambience for meals with guests and demonstrate how technology can be used to complement food in everyday meals and special occasions. Our findings make recommendation about the need for HCI research to recognize the contextual nature of technology usage during family mealtimes and to adopt appropriate design strategies.

Title: Engaging in Videogame Play: An Activity-Centric Analysis of the Player Experience

Abstract: This paper focuses on examining play activities in people's favourite videogame experience. Through interviews with 30 videogame players we discovered which types of play activities are most appealing. Our research identifies the level of appeal of a wide range of game play activities. We have established that high levels of engagement for many participants is grounded in play as power and play as strategy, with play as fantasy adding to the experience. Through our study we established that conflict-based activities hold strong appeal. We subsequently investigated the context in which players talked about their experience of conflict within game. By using activities as a categorisation of gameplay we have been able to capture the play experience across a range of games and a range of gaming contexts. By examining players' individual experience we begin to understand why conflict in videogames appears to be a popular choice of activities.

Title: Redefining Videogame Reward Types

Abstract: The aim of our research is to iteratively refine and begin validating a proposed videogame reward typology and its associated definitions. A mixed methods approach has been taken so as to best evaluate and refine the taxonomy. The views of an expert focus group have been explored and considered. Separately, a review of the videogame rewards observed within recreational videogames has been undertaken and analyzed. The collective findings of both the focus group and the videogame reward review have prompted the redesign of an existing videogame reward taxonomy, resulting in more robust definitions with increased applicability.

Title: Exploring Boredom Proneness as a Predictor of Mobile Phone Use in the Car

Abstract: Driver distraction through mobile phone use in the car is a growing road safety concern. This paper presents findings of a survey (N = 528), which seeks to better understand the predictors of mobile phone use while driving in young (18-25) adult drivers. The survey investigated factors and motivations such as young adults' boredom proneness and their social connectedness, as well as their general mobile phone use and phone use in the car. We found, e.g., that boredom proneness plays a larger role (compared to social connectedness) in determining how much a young male uses their phone in the car (compared to young females). Despite the study's limitations, this initial understanding allows us to better design and develop innovative HCI interventions that prevent young adults, particularly males, from phone use while driving in a way that appeals to their needs.

Title: Values-led Participatory Design as a Pursuit of Meaningful Alternatives

Abstract: Participatory Design (PD) is inherently concerned with inquiring into and supporting human values when designing IT. We argue that a PD approach that is led by a focus upon participants' values can allow participants to discover meaningful alternatives -- alternative uses and alternative conceptualizations for IT that are particularly meaningful to them. However, how PD works with values in the design process has not been made explicit. In this paper, we aim to (i) explicate this values-led PD approach, (ii) illustrate how this approach can lead to outcomes that are meaningful alternatives, and (iii) explain the nature of meaningful alternatives. We use a PD case study to illustrate how we work with participants in a values-led PD approach towards meaningful alternatives.

Title: MyCalendar: Fostering Communication for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder through Photos and Videos

Abstract: This paper presents MyCalendar; a visual calendar prototype App that was developed to support children with Autism Spectrum Disorder and language delays to communicate about their own activities and interests across the settings of home and school.MyCalendar was developed following in-depth fieldwork and participatory design sessions with parents, teachers and children from Preparatory year to year 2 of an Australian Primary School Special Education Unit catering largely for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Typically, children with ASD face difficulties in participating at school.MyCalendar was then evaluated over six months with four teachers, ten parents and eleven children. The study resulted in two key findings: (1) MyCalendar supported children who have ASD and limited verbal skills to better communicate their daily personal activities through photos and videos, encouraged by teachers and parents. (2) This deeper understanding of the children's daily lives enabled teachers to successfully model positive behaviours and to scaffold more relevant and meaningful learning opportunities by relating them to the children's lives.While it was initially expected that the activities would better support communication between teachers and parents, the MyCalendar led in fact to novel scaffolding of learning opportunities and modeling of communication in the classroom.

Title: INSERT: Efficient Sorting of Images on Mobile Devices

Abstract: We amass increasing amounts of photos on our mobile devices, primarily captured by built-in cameras. These cameras provide precious opportunities to preserve memories or serve for creative engagement. However, creating order over these vast photo collections gets more difficult as we create more and more photos and this puts these valuable resources at risk. People fail to sort their photo collections manually and automated algorithms are not yet able to identify and group images based on the features that are most relevant to the human beholder. For these reasons we present INSERT, a novel mobile phone application for supporting manual sorting of photo collections in an efficient fashion. A user study featuring 21 participants showed that the proposed interaction mechanisms were well perceived and that there is yet much research to be conducted aiming at the management of image collections on mobile device, in particular with small screens.

Title: Framing Technology Design in Ubuntu: Two Locales in Pastoral Namibia

Abstract: Situating technology design in the African philosophy of Ubuntu, emphasizes principles of humanness and connectedness in human interactions. Curiosity, interest and learnings have grown among those who have co-designed with us for the past eight years; whereas those who have just began co-designing endeavours take on it in different and also similar manners. This reminds us of our beginnings and initial aims as co-designers in diverse Namibians milieus. Thus, as we exit the known and arrive to anew terrains, we observe different but also similar values, protocols and behaviours amid diverse co-designer groups; also in the way we evolve as researchers co-designing always with the above. Human values at Ovaherero and Ovahimba rural locales depict and magnified differences and also commonalities that, altogether, come as Ubuntu in the sharing and in the practiced philosophy of African indigenous populations; also of us as researcher co-designers. This paper reflects on how Human-Computer Interaction and technology deal with communities' daily living and humanness in various ways.

Title: Proxy Users, Use By Proxy: Mapping Forms of Intermediary Interaction

Abstract: Within Human-Computer Interaction and Internet Studies there is a growing interest in non-users, which articulates the increasingly diverse modes of digital media engagement that slip between established categories of user/non-user, online/offline and self/other. In this paper we aim to build on these concerns and their disciplinary intersections to map emerging forms of computer interaction and social media participation that can be grouped together under the concept of proxy users -- intermediaries that act on behalf of others. This preliminary mapping work, surveying a number of research projects and studies involving the authors, begins to trace the diversity of agents, roles, contexts, and motivations of proxy users.

Title: Understanding the Use of a Bug Tracking System in a Global Software Development Setup

Abstract: Bug fixing is a highly cooperative work activity where developers, testers, product managers and other stakeholders collaborate using a bug tracking system. In the context of Global Software Development (GSD), where software development is distributed across different geographical locations, we focus on understanding the role of bug trackers in supporting software bug fixing activities. We carried out a small-scale ethnographic fieldwork in a software product team distributed between Finland and India at a multinational engineering company. Using semi-structured interviews and in-situ observations of 16 bug cases, we show that the bug tracker 1) supported information needs of different stake holder, 2) established common-ground, and 3) reinforced issues related to ownership, performance and power. Consequently, we provide implications for design around these findings.

Title: Touchless Gestural Interaction with Wizard-of-Oz: Analysing User Behaviour

Abstract: In many gestural interfaces, the gesture set is developed or trained by real users, but many use gestures with unchanging definition that do not account for variation between different users or performances. Over time, if the user performs gestures different, the definition should evolve to accommodate these changes. We performed a Wizard-of-Oz experiment with a user-defined gesture system to determine if participant's gestures changed over repeated performances, and when and why these changes occurred. The results showed that although the definitions provided changed in a unique way for each participant, most reported their gestures as becoming simpler and less difficult to perform over time.

Title: Robots in Rehab: Towards socially assistive robots for paediatric rehabilitation

Abstract: There is increasing interest in the use of socially assistive robots to enhance therapeutic outcomes in paediatric health care. In this paper we report on experiential use of the humanoid 'NAO' robot (Aldebaran Robotics) in a paediatric rehabilitation setting. This forms part of a proposed study assessing the clinical benefits of introducing the NAO as a therapeutic intervention in the rehabilitation program of children with cerebral palsy (CP). This study is in partnership with the rehabilitation clinic of Melbourne's Royal Children's Hospital. Drawing on five months of regular weekly engagement with the rehabilitation clinic, we propose roles and supporting capabilities for the NAO that aim to enhance rehabilitation outcomes for patients and support the typical workflow of therapists. We provide an overview of development work conducted to support these roles, and discuss future work and technical challenges to be addressed in preparation for the study.

Title: Children's Expectations and Strategies in Interacting with a Wizard of Oz Robot

Abstract: This paper presents an analysis of children's interactions with an early prototype of a robot that is being designed for deployment in early learning centres. 23 children aged 2-6 interacted with the prototype, consisting of a pair of tablets embedded in a flat and vaguely humanoid form. We used a Wizard of Oz (WoZ) technique to control a synthesized voice that delivered predefined statements and questions, and a tablet mounted as a head that displayed animated eyes. The children's interactions with the robot and with the adult experimenter were video recorded and analysed in order to identify some of the children's expectations of the robot's behaviour and capabilities, and to observe their strategies for interacting with a speaking and minimally animated artificial agent. We found a surprising breadth in children's reactions, expectations and strategies (as evidenced by their behaviour) and a noteworthy tolerance for the robot's occasionally awkward behaviour.

Title: KineticCanvas: Synergetic Effort Between Art and Technology

Abstract: Kinetic Canvas is an attempt to synergise art and technology, where artists can animate paintings on their drawing canvas to represent a passage of time. We collaborated with a professional artist who works on "nihonga" artwork (artwork that features traditional Japanese techniques) to create a 5 feet by 3 feet art piece for a public exhibition. This paper presents the development process of the artwork, challenges faced by both the artist and the technologist and reflections on the synergetic effort.

Title: Fyro: A Symbolic-Based Phatic Technology

Abstract: This paper presents a symbolic-based phatic technology system. In contrast to previous work, which explored phatic technology as abstract-, object-, and behavior-based system, we designed Fyro as a symbolic-based system inspired by the symbolic use of fire in the ritual of lighting up a candle when thinking of loved ones. When a user lights up a candle in Fyro, a heart-shaped light on a remote Fyro is turned on, and it stays on as long as the candle in the other Fyro is burning. As a precursor to deploying Fyro in domestic settings, we demonstrated it in two future technology workshops to elicit user feedback. Data were analysed using affinity diagram. Although previous research indicates that users project their own context to create meanings in phatic interactions, our results show that symbolic universal traditions may be innovated to extend its meaning into such interactions.

Title: Positive Ageing: Elements and factors for design

Abstract: A significant number of models and frameworks have introduced, and been used to support, positive approaches to ageing. They include Successful Ageing, Active Ageing and Ageing in Place, among others. The number of models can create confusion for technology designers who wish to incorporate such models into practice. This paper reviews different models of positive ageing in order to distil a comprehensive list of elements and factors that are important to, and supportive of, positive ageing. This list offers designers a useful source for considering the design of technology to support positive ageing. Finally, we discuss some gaps found in existing models and offer some insights into how designers could use this paper as a resource for design.

Title: Playful Card-Based Tools for Gamification Design

Abstract: This paper presents a card-based toolset to assist in the gamification design process for business processes, products and services. Grounded in the concepts of design games and design card methodologies, four sets of cards have been developed to facilitate creative problem solving and the prototyping of gamification design projects. Seven workshops have been run involving 114 project managers in experimenting with the prototype cards to design applications in human resource management, training, marketing, and innovation management. Using the cards focuses participants on the development of designs that are human-centred and on embedding values and ethics into the final design artifacts. The field of gamification is at an early stage of development and is limited by a lack of rigorous frameworks and design methods. This work contributes to closing this gap with practical tools and frameworks.

Title: Designing for Collections: Building Histories, Sharing the Spectacle

Abstract: The hobby of collecting represents the passionate acquisition and possession of a specific type(s) of object; creating a 'spectacle', to be shared with others. The fundamentality of the physical objects in collections against the backdrop of the growing ubiquity of computing provides a unique and compelling avenue for design. Based on interviews with 11 self-identified collectors, this paper discusses the role collectors have in informing HCI design and in turn, the potential HCI has in designing technology to assist collectors in sharing what we term the 'spectacle' of collecting. Toward this, we suggest two ideas for future designs, including building personal histories of individual collectable items and developing a simple digital means of connecting proximate collectors with those who stand to benefit from collectors' unique and item-specific knowledge.

Title: So You Think You Are a Multitasker?: A Qualitative Study to Understand Multitasking

Abstract: In the present day, the need and ability to multitask in or across devices is growing. However, these multitasking abilities are being introduced to devices without considering the effect they have on the cognitive workload of a user and its impact on one's productivity. Through our study described in this paper, we attempt to understand multitasking from a qualitative perspective by exploring the difference in multitasking behaviour of users when they deal with active and passive tasks. We also identify workarounds devised by users in order to minimize their cognitive workload while multitasking across apps on their mobile devices. Finally, we suggest certain guidelines that could be adopted by technology companies to aid users in effectively handling interruptions and switching across applications.

Title: Free-hand Gesture Interfaces for an Augmented Exhibition Podium

Abstract: In this paper we present an augmented exhibition podium that supports natural free-hand 3D interaction for visitors using their own mobile phones or Smart Glasses. Visitors can point the camera of their mobile phones or Smart Glasses at the podium to see Augmented Reality (AR) content overlaid on a physical exhibit, and can also use their free-hand gestures to interact with the AR content. For instance, they can use pinching gestures to select different parts of the exhibit with their fingers to view augmented text descriptions, instead of touching the mobile phone screen. The prototype combines vision-based image tracking and free-hand gesture detection via a depth camera in a client-server framework, which enables users to use their hands with the augmented exhibition without requiring special hardware (e.g. a depth sensor) on their personal devices. Results from our pilot user study shows that the prototype system is as intuitive to use as a traditional touch-based interface, and provides a more fun and engaging experience.

Title: Everybody Dance Now: Tensions between Participation and Performance in Interactive Public Installations

Abstract: In this paper, we report on Encounters, an interactive public installation that provides a basis for studying the effect of dance performances on the emergence of creative, social experiences. Based on observations and interviews with dancers and participants, we identified a range of tensions that arise from integrating a staged performance with participatory interaction. These tensions occurred among both participants and performers, and influenced the social and performative experience. Based on our analysis, we propose several strategies to smoothen the integration of performative and participatory interaction. These strategies reconsider the role of the interactive installation, the effect of digital cues that draw on existing conventions, and mechanisms to direct gaze. We believe our findings and strategies are valuable to HCI researchers and performative artists seeking to design for public participation in interactive experiences.

Title: Playful Hacking within Research-through-Design

Abstract: Research-through-design has gained popularity in recent years within HCI communities. This has followed with attempts to methodize and formalize design practices within research contexts. These attempts have been criticized as being poorly suited for design. As an exemplification of unstructured methods benefiting design research, we present playful hacking within research-through-design. In this paper we share findings from two years of using this approach as part of research-through-design. In our approach, hacking is inspired by play and conducted within an office as a hacker's playground environment. We have found playful hacking to generate outcomes such as improved collaboration, exploration, and discussion while also generating unanticipated outcomes such as reusable design work and pre-study findings. Above all, we found that hacking provided motivation and invigoration to do more making and research in general.

Title: Interact: A Mixed Reality Virtual Survivor for Holocaust Testimonies

Abstract: In this paper we present Interact---a mixed reality virtual survivor for Holocaust education. It was created to preserve the powerful and engaging experience of listening to, and interacting with, Holocaust survivors, allowing future generations of audience access to their unique stories. Interact demonstrates how advanced filming techniques, 3D graphics and natural language processing can be integrated and applied to specially-recorded testimonies to enable users to ask questions and receive answers from that virtualised individuals. This provides a new and rich interactive narratives of remembrance to engage with primary testimony. We discuss the design and development of Interact, and argue that this new form of mixed reality is promising media to overcome the uncanny valley.

Title: GazeTry: Swipe Text Typing Using Gaze

Abstract: Over the last decades, eye gaze has become an alternative form of text entry by some physically challenged people. Recently a dwell-free system has been proposed, which has been proven to be much faster compared to other existing dwell-free systems. However, it is vulnerable to some common text entry problems. In the paper, we propose GazeTry, a dwell-free gaze-based text entry system which allows people to type a word by gazing sequentially at the letters of the word. Simulation and experiments results show that our proposed new dwell-free system, GazeTry with the Moving Window String Matching (MoWing) algorithm has better accuracy and more resilience to text entry errors.

Title: It feels different from real life: Users' Opinions of Mobile Applications for Mental Health

Abstract: Mobile applications for mental health are being used by people suffering from mental health disorders. However, there is a paucity of knowledge in relation to their opinions about such applications. The aim of this study is to understand users' needs and expectations to self-manage their mental health through the use of mobile apps for mental health and to highlight possible design opportunities. We collected and analysed comments and reviews of users on a community forum, Reddit, and Apple's iTunes and Google's Google Play stores. We identified four requirements of technology related to: emotional use, real life context, users' interpretation about themselves and social aspects. Based upon our findings we proposed further exploration of two design sensitivities: Self-reflection and Co-experience.

Title: Lights, Camera, Action: Using animations to co-evaluate user experience scenarios

Abstract: Scenarios are considered a useful tool for designers and HCI communities to generate detailed problem descriptions, future predictions, concept generations, requirements analysis and detailed system design surrounding a design problem. However, little is known about animated scenarios as a tool to co-evaluate and further explore early user research insights and themes with end users. In this study, previous research findings and insights concerning emergency alarm pendants were designed and presented as animated scenarios to older participants in a workshop. Emergency alarms are wearable product technologies that allow the user to alert designated contacts in the event of falls or medical emergencies and were chosen as a case study for this paper. The findings indicate, that while the animated scenarios provide a basis for participants to describe problems associated with using the emergency alarm technology, participants also used the animated scenarios to discus and evaluate the key emotions and themes that were presented. We refer to this process as co-evaluate. It is argued that animated scenarios can be used to validate the HCI designers' understanding and interpretation of early user research insights and themes.

Title: Digitised Necrophilia: Technology and Psychosocial Orientations in the Age of ISIS and Drone Warfare

Abstract: In this paper, I draw on the work of psychoanalyst Erich Fromm and his postulation of fundamental psychosocial orientations -- necrophilia and biophilia -- to reflect on two contemporary exemplars of human-computer interaction: the use of media communications technology by the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) and the military use of weaponised drones. I consider the emergence of these modes of human-computer interaction located at the extremities of our social world as a key historical moment requiring urgent reflection on the interfaces of the psyche, the social, and the digital.

Title: What We Learned from TransitionMate: A Mobile App Designed to Support Young People with Chronic Illness

Abstract: Young people with chronic illness eventually undergo transition from paediatric to adult healthcare. This is often a complex and daunting process for adolescents, requiring significant adjustment and increased autonomy to manage illness within the context of young people's daily lives. The ubiquitous nature of mobile phones facilitates novel communication channels to engage, support and empower young people to take greater control of their illness management and to improve health outcomes during this crucial period. In this paper, we present a novel mobile phone application aimed at supporting self-management and transition in young people with chronic illness. Nine participants completed a pilot study using the application, and we discuss the outcomes of the study in this paper.

Title: FaceSwitch - Low-Cost Accessibility Software for Computer Control Combining Gaze Interaction and Face Gestures

Abstract: We introduce here the FaceSwitch, an accessibility software system designed to facilitate computer interaction for users who are challenged in the mobility of their upper limbs. The FaceSwitch software tracks landmark features in a user's face using a deformable face tracker. The system lets the user map specific facial gestures to customized computer control commands such as left click, right-click, page down or escape through a convenient GUI. Hence, facial gestures act as substitutes of traditional mechanical switches. When combining facial gestures with gaze interaction, the emergent multimodal interaction paradigm improves the degrees of freedom offered by alternative accessibility software such as gaze only interaction, speech interaction or mechanical single-switch assisted gaze interaction. Furthermore, the FaceSwitch software improves the efficacy of traditional gaze interaction which has been traditionally limited by a high rate of false positives due to its dependence on target acquisition via dwell time activation. The FaceSwitch also reduces the latency to achieve a computer control task when compared to traditional accessibility software. We have made the FaceSwitch widely available in order for those in need to use it without restrictions and also to allow those with the right technical skills to potentially improve the software further.

Title: Good Frustrations: The Paradoxical Pleasure of Fearing Death in DayZ

Abstract: The design of modern digital games has become increasingly oriented towards providing players with positive experiences such as fun and flow, and reducing negative experiences such as frustration and anger. DayZ is one notable exception, where negative experiences are central to its design. When a player is killed in DayZ, they lose their character with all its advancement, often equivalent to weeks of play, which can be an enormously frustrating and demoralising experience. However, the majority of its players view this as a positive and attractive feature, and one of the keys to the game's appeal. In this paper, we draw on 1,704 responses to a player motivations survey to unpack the complex player experience of permanent character death and demonstrate how this moment of negative affect contributes to the positive experience of DayZ more broadly.

Title: Older Adults' Use of a Novel Communication System: Client Goals versus Participant Experiences

Abstract: This paper reports on the outcomes of a collaborative industry project which designed and deployed a novel communication systems for older adults. We outline a gap between the goals of our industry partner and the needs and experiences of our participants. We highlight the need to carefully consider the location of set-up, the training needs of older people, and any existing social support networks and technological systems already in use, while ultimately recognising the emotional connections of older people. These contextual factors influence individual older adults' acceptance, use and adoption of novel technologies such as the one presented in this paper.

Title: Back-of-Device Interaction based on the Range of Motion of the Index Finger

Abstract: We show a back-of-device (BoD) interaction based on the range of motion of the index finger to improve the usability of a touchscreen mobile device held in one hand. To design this interaction, we conducted two experiments to investigate the range of motion of the index finger on the back of mobile devices. On the basis of those results, we designed a prototype system that has a hole in the back, where users perform our BoD interaction by covering the hole with their index finger. This design provides them with the tactile feedback provided by a hole, and allows users to naturally control the front and back simultaneously.

Title: Bi-Cultural Content Publication on a Digital Noticeboard: a Design and Cultural Differences Case Study

Abstract: We present our observations of Aboriginal Australian practices around a custom digital noticeboard and compare our insights to related research on cultural differences, literacy and ICT4D. The digital noticeboard was created, upon a request by the community Elders, to foster communication across the community. The initial design, informed by discussions and consultations, aimed at supporting the local Aboriginal language and English, both in written and spoken form, at supporting the oral tradition, and at accommodating for different perceptions and representations of time. This paper presents observations about the first encounters with the digital noticeboard by those members of the community that took part in its conceptualization. Such observations reinforce existing knowledge on such cultural phenomena as collectivism and time perception, issues related to literacy, moderation and censorship. We contribute to framing such knowledge within a concrete case study and draw implication for design of tools for bi-cultural content publication.

Title: An Implementation of Tangible Interactive Mapping to Improve Adult Learning for Preparing for Bushfire

Abstract: Our tangible touch table interface mapping system was designed for adults to complete short map-based interactive problem solving tasks using purpose-designed model objects. The table interface was compared with the closest existing traditionally equivalent method using a within subjects exercise of 64 adult members of the general public in-situ at the local library and museum.The hypothesis investigated whether "a tangible multi-touch table interface improved understanding of preparing for bushfire using map-based constructivist learning tasks". The system design and content founded upon adult learning preferences (Knowles et al. 2005) further evolved using an iterative process by participatory involvement with three bushfire community groups.After using the preparing for bushfire tangible interactive mapping system all of the participants improved upon their pre-test scores indicating that they learned from the experience (t(31)=-9.08,p<0.001).

Title: Designing Real Time Assistive Technologies: A Study of Children with ADHD

Abstract: Children with mental disorders like Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) often experience challenges in school as they struggle to maintain their attention. Based on empirical studies conducted in school contexts and together with teachers and ADHD domain professionals, we identified design criteria in relation to three core components (sensing, recognizing, and assisting) for designing real time assistive technologies for children with ADHD. Based on these design criteria, we designed the Child Activity Sensing and Training Tool (CASTT), a real time assistive prototype that captures activities and assists the child in maintaining attention. From a preliminary evaluation of CASTT with 20 children in several schools, we and found that: 1) it is possible to create a wearable sensor system for children with ADHD that monitors physical and physiological activities in real time; and that 2) real time assistive technologies have potential to assist children with ADHD in regaining attention in critical school situations.

Title: Anthropological User Research: A Data-Driven Approach to Personas Development

Abstract: In user experience design process, personas development is an expensive endeavor, which often involves allocating resources in an organization for a prolonged period. Design teams working under practical constraints demand increasingly a practical personas development approach. This study presents a novel data-driven personas development method with its root in anthropological research methods of frame elicitation and multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis. In this paper, we discuss the merits and potential improvements to this new approach with a case study to illustrate its application in a multinational software company.

Title: Indicators of wellbeing in recreational video game players

Abstract: Video game play is a popular entertainment choice, yet we have a limited understanding of the potential wellbeing benefits associated with recreational play. An online survey (final sample, n = 297) addresses this by investigating how the player experience related to wellbeing. The impact of amount of play, game genre, mode of play (social or solitary play) and the psychological experience of play (flow and need satisfaction) on a multi-dimensional measure of wellbeing (emotional, psychological and social) was examined via hierarchical regression. Age, gender, the play of casual games compared to shooters, and in-game experiences of flow, autonomy and relatedness were associated with increases in dimensions of wellbeing.

Title: Virtual Food Court: A VR environment to Assess People's Food Choices

Abstract: Immersive virtual reality environments can provide users with realistic experiences of worlds that do not exist or would be hard to reach. The ability to manipulate these environments and influence experiences can be used to understand decision making under different conditions. In this study we explore how VR can be used to understand more about people's food choices. We explore how policy-based interventions such as the "sugar tax" and "nutrition labelling" to promote healthier food choices could be tested. Only limited experimental studies have been conducted about such choices due to the difficulty of trying such interventions in large retail settings. The objectives of the study were to assess how accurately the Virtual Food Court (VFC), represents a real food court. The study (27 participants) had two study conditions; a control with regular food-court prices, and an experimental condition with taxes on food and beverages. Results revealed that participants were able to imagine doing their real-life food purchases in the VFC indicating that it is a good research tool for assessing people's food choices.

Title: To Dwell or Not to Dwell: An Evaluation of Mid-Air Gestures for Large Information Displays

Abstract: This paper investigates user preferences for mid-air gestures to interact with large public information displays. We designed and implemented a public display application that allows people to navigate between Twitter feeds and to find details about particular tweets. The application supports selection and navigation through (1) point-and-dwell and (2) push and grab-and-pull. A within-subject evaluation with 10 participants found that although point-and-dwell was perceived to be more accurate, push was preferred for selecting items and grab-and-pull was preferred for navigation. Based on our findings we derive recommendations for designing gesture-based information displays.

Title: DIVE: Fluid Display for 3D CG Manipulation with Visual Continuity

Abstract: In this paper, we propose "DIVE", an intuitive 3D CG manipulation system with fluid display. DIVE displays 3D CG objects on the surface of a tank that is filled with opaque liquid. DIVE's user inserts his/her arm into the fluid display, and manipulates the CG objects by the hand under the liquid surface. DIVE also displays a CG hand (virtual hand) on the surface instead of the unseen hand under the surface. The virtual hand seems to be joined to the user's real arm above the surface. Its appearance and motion are synchronized with that of the unseen hand. Using DIVE, we can feel as if we are manipulating 3D CG objects with our own hand. Experimental results showed that the prototype could provide acceptable accuracy and stability in a part of the fluid display.

Title: Exploring Trust in Bitcoin Technology: A Framework for HCI Research

Abstract: Bitcoin is a crypto-currency which differs in several ways from the traditional use of money. It does not require an individual name but digital wallet IDs, which makes it more private. Bitcoin technology currently lacks protection with respect to monetary transfers, and its structure is not endorsed by the governments. Yet, understanding the concept of trust is fundamental to Bitcoin technology and digital currency economy. This paper offers a review of relevant work on cryptocurrency and trust in HCI, and critically examines its value in understanding the issues of trust in Bitcoin technology. Several limitations of the current theories and models of trust are identified, and a research framework is proposed to explore the specific trust challenges raised by the Bitcoin technology.

Title: A Collaborative Approach to Design Individualized Technologies with People with a Disability

Abstract: Designing individualized technologies to suit unique needs and wants of people can enhance their quality of life. This paper explores the challenges in bringing together different communities with the necessary skill sets to design such technologies for and with people with a disability. A collaborative approach involving a maker community, a disability services organization, and university staff and students was investigated through the theoretical lens of infrastructuring. Maker communities can potentially provide skilled and willing volunteers, while disability services organizations possess disability sector expertise and the university can contribute design expertise through its staff and students. While these parties complement each other, tensions can arise that require resolution. Through ethnography and co-design this study identified key tensions that arise in a collaboration including differences in motivations, the importance of sensitive and accurate need finding, managing expectations, and leveraging health and safety standards. Resolution of these tensions can lead the way to more sustainable collaborative projects.

Title: Wearable audio-video recorders as a tool for investigating child play experiences in nature

Abstract: Designing digital technologies that support children in middle childhood (8-12 years) play in nature can instil environmental values that motivate pro-environmental behaviour. However, gathering real-time and situated insights into children's independent play experiences in nature is often challenging as children of this age group are often secretive about their play activities and 'special play places'. Wearable video recorders present an opportunity for overcoming many barriers to understanding children's play experiences. Here we present a study where we provided twelve children (8-11 years) with a wearable video recorder while they played in their special place in nature. We then analysed the data to determine how these devices uniquely contribute to our understanding of the children's play experience. Our analysis found that wearable audio-video recorders provide a unique and rich perspective on children's play from the point of view of the child. The data captured was situated, naturalistic, spatial-temporal, social and visceral.

Title: Operationalising and Measuring Flow in Video Games

Abstract: This paper explores the obstacles associated with designing video game levels for the purpose of objectively measuring flow. We sought to create three video game levels capable of inducing a flow state, an overload state (low-flow), and a boredom state (low-flow). A pilot study, in which participants self-reported levels of flow after playing all three game levels, was undertaken. Unexpected results point to the challenges of operationalising flow in video game research, obstacles in experimental design for invoking flow and low-flow, concerns about flow as a construct for measuring video game enjoyment, the applicability of self-report flow scales, and the experience of flow in video game play despite substantial challenge-skill differences.

Title: Three is a crowd? Our experience of testing large-scale social software in a usability lab

Abstract: 'In the wild' testing has been the cornerstone of HCI in past attempts to create large scale social software, such as conference software. Conversely mobile software is frequently tested in a lab environment, thus banishing typical context of use. In this paper we present our attempt at merging the two approaches for conference social software. We tested in the lab, but attempted to replicate some of the social context of field-based testing. We report our learnings and propose future research for this type of hybrid testing.

Title: Visual Analytics for Large-Scale Bioinformatic Data Sets

Abstract: Rapid advances in sequencing technologies (Next Generation Sequencing or NGS) have led to a vast increase in the quantity of bioinformatics data available, with this increasing scale presenting enormous challenges to researchers seeking to identify complex interactions. This paper is concerned with the domain of transcriptional regulation, and the use of visualisation to identify relationships between specific regulatory proteins (the transcription factors or TFs) and their associated target genes (TGs). We present preliminary work from an ongoing study which aims to determine the effectiveness of different visual representations and large scale displays in supporting discovery. Following an iterative process of implementation and evaluation, representations were tested by potential users in the bioinformatics domain to determine their efficacy, and to understand better the range of ad hoc practices among bioinformatics literate users. Results from two rounds of small scale user studies are considered with initial findings suggesting that bioinformaticians require richly detailed views of TF data, features to compare TF layouts between organisms quickly, and ways to keep track of interesting data points.

Title: Radial Cursor: an Efficient Technique to Explore Radial Hierarchy Visualizations on Touch Screens

Abstract: Mouse hover is a common and effective solution in data visualization applications to deal with the "representation problem". Yet it remains un-developed or overlooked with touch screens, which has recently gained popularity in both people's daily life and research studies. In this paper, we proposed an interaction technique named radial cursor, which uses a radial metaphor and functions similar to a mouse cursor. It stimulates 'mouse hover' interaction with radial hierarchical data on touch screens. Together with a level switch, radial cursor provide intuitive and effective controls of 'hover to see more detail' or 'hover to highlight' over every data node. We also applied real dataset such as Flickr taxonomy and Flare package to our design. The result shows radial cursor helps user to quickly get a general sense of an unfamiliar dataset, or review the known dataset. Meanwhile, radial cursor provides a pleasant data exploration experience.

Title: The Emerging Technology Consumer: Designing NUI Interaction for Learning and Retention

Abstract: Natural User Interfaces (NUIs) paired with new, emerging technologies are moving into the consumer mainstream, however there is still a lack of standard guidance when it comes to designing for these technologies. This impacts the facilitation and maximisation of user learning and retention of any new interaction techniques. In this paper, we present a case study investigating current approaches to interaction design in NUIs in relation to two emerging technologies: the Oculus Rift virtual reality headset and the Leap Motion controller. We recommend a set of four guidelines, the application of which will help to facilitate user learning of interaction methods and techniques, and maximise user satisfaction in future NUIs.

Title: Building Personas of Students Accessing a Peer-Facilitated Support for Learning Program

Abstract: The modern student represents a change from the traditional learner. More than ever before, additional resources are available online and yet personalised learning and peer-assistance programs are becoming an essential part of tertiary education delivery. This paper presents the first stage in a user-centred design approach to the analysis of the completeness and efficacy of such a personalised, peer-based support for learning program. This approach used an iterative design methodology based on contextual interview, workshops and focus groups to develop personas representing students visiting the program. Initial uses of these developed personas have included training of new personnel as well as the evaluation of the program. Overall the use of this user-centred approach and iterative persona development methodology has yielded an invaluable resource for the design of support for learning programs across the higher education industry within Australia and beyond.

Title: Health Information Seeking Behavior among College Students: A case in a Developing Country

Abstract: Literature on Health Information Seeking Behavior (HISB) are available and well documented in developed countries. People in developed countries have also better understanding and awareness on online health information sources. However, the research coverage is very limited in developing countries, especially among college students. Previous studies showed higher risks of chronic diseases, stress, and risky sexual behavior among college students. Improving their HISB has the potential to reduce these risks. Our proposed research attempts to describe HISB and its associated factors in developing country with a specific focus on a college student population. Our study will attempt to create a better understanding of HISB in developing country thereby making it available for health promotional activities. It will also have potential contribution to suggest design strategies to improve health information retrieval systems.

Title: Science Fiction and the Reality of HCI: Inspirations, Achievements or a Mismatch

Abstract: The aim of this workshop is to explore and exchange ideas on topics emerging from both science fiction and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). In particular, the main aims are to discuss the contradictions between science fiction and HCI, explore and elaborate on various methodologies that can be used to evaluate fictional content, and how fiction can be used to inspire design.

Title: Some Notes on the Design of "World Machines"

Abstract: We offer the idea of world machines as a new archetype for systems that draw together computational powers to connect, sense and infer with a social agenda of cross-world collaboration. This archetype builds on existing socio-technical systems with global reach, to raise the profile of tools that maintain a collaborative agenda and resist a tendency towards networks as giant surveillance and marketing devices. We use the case study of designing a bio-acoustic observatory to consider key characteristics and challenges for this thought experiment.We highlight systems to empower better human nature in line with the conference theme of being human. The paper asks how technical tools can be both ecological and enchanting, to present a positive model of development and prompt transformation towards lived understanding of custodianship, cooperation and co-created resilience. In doing so, we consider a way that technology can support the future of resource-management, counter-balancing its own resource-hungry nature.

Title: Supporting Ideation by Integrating Exploratory Search, Browsing, and Curation

Abstract: This research integrates exploratory search, browsing, and curation in information-based ideation (IBI) environments, to support users finding, discovering, and combining web content. Information-based ideation refers to open-ended activities in which humans work to imagine, generate, and develop new problems and solutions. We use web semantics as a basis for summarizing and representing heterogeneous content from diverge sources involved in ideation tasks. To enable working with web semantics, we develop a novel type system that brings together data models, dynamic extraction, and presentation of semantic information. Based on the web semantics type system, we build interfaces that preserve contexts during exploratory browsing, and plan to build integrated interactive environments to address exploratory search, curation, and ideation. We will investigate how integrated environments affect people's practices with finding and combining information, and derive new principles for supporting exploratory search, browsing, curation, and ideation. Methods, techniques, and findings developed through this research have the potential to transform infrastructures and human experiences of the web.

Title: Ethical Encounters: HCI Research in Sensitive and Complex Settings

Abstract: Ethics is emerging as a key issue for HCI researchers working in increasingly sensitive and complex settings. New technologies are now designed and evaluated in settings with vulnerable or marginalised participants, which can be emotionally challenging for researchers and give rise to complex ethical dilemmas that are highly contextualized and difficult to plan for. Further, discrepancies may arise between the structured processes of formal ethics approval in universities and other organisations and the realities of HCI fieldwork 'in the wild'. This workshop builds on our CHI 2015 workshop, providing an opportunity for HCI researchers and others to communally reflect on ethical encounters in HCI research. We particularly focus on situational ethics, researcher wellbeing, maintaining boundaries around the research, issues of consent and participation, and ethical issues arising from the disruption that new technologies cause. We aim to develop a handbook of practical lessons arising from ethical issues encountered in HCI research in sensitive and complex settings.

Title: Building Realistic Simulations for Interactive Information Retrieval

Abstract: Simulation has been used within the field of Information Retrieval (IR) for many years to evaluate retrieval models and other aspects of the wider IR process. In recent years, there has been a renewed interest towards using simulation for Interactive Information Retrieval (IIR), an area which focuses on the study of human interactions with IR systems. A variety of different interaction models (e.g. click models) associated with behavioural aspects of searchers have over time been developed and evaluated using simulation in order for us to better understand the complex processes involved. Despite these advances, such models are still relatively naïve, and further work is required to make simulations of searchers more realistic. To this end, this project seeks to build more realistic simulations, using a more Complex Searcher Model (CSM). Within the CSM, each component and decision point can be varied and customised as required. The CSM can then be instantiated using components that are grounded from empirical evidence based upon actual real-world searcher behaviour and interaction data.

Title: Back to the Future: Identifying Interface Trends from the Past, Present and Future in Immersive Applications

Abstract: The new generation of Head Mounted Displays (HMDs) is beginning to make the much-anticipated arrival of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) in consumer products reality. A large body of research from the last three decades has laid the foundation for the concepts now emerging in the market. Yet, there has been little focus on the analysis of consumer user interfaces being produced for these new platforms. As technology is progressing, there is an increasing need to study current trends in user and developer communities, and to contextualise them within the ongoing evolution of human-computer interfaces. In this paper, we specifically focus on mixed reality (MR) within immersed simulations enabled through combining VR headsets with vision sensors. We present an analysis of apps on the Leap Motion market and outline suggestions for developers and designers to assist with creating more natural user interface experiences.

Title: Information Retrieval Behaviors among EBM Practitioners when performing Evidence Based Medicine

Abstract: This paper reveals the preliminary analysis of how EBM practitioners retrieve EBM related information during their clinical rounds at a public teaching hospital in Malaysia. We focused on studying EBM practitioners' searching behaviors during EBM process. However, in this paper we only present analysis for query issuing pattern and result viewing behavior of the retrieval process. We collected our preliminary data using Morae's Key-Logging software that captures participants' information searching behavior. We recorded 30 preliminary search sessions via convenience sampling and analyzed our data using descriptive statistics. Our findings indicate that 90% of the search sessions successfully returned results that the participants searched for. Among the queries issued, 24.47% were ineffective queries. Result viewing behaviors revealed 56 online sources were clicked where 33.33% belonged to PubMed, Medscape and UpToDate. Our result shows higher average query length and the number of medical terms used in queries compared to previous studies. We also found that result viewing behavior using multiple tabs confuses the participants and are more likely to cause overlooking of online resources on some of the opened tabs. The outcome of our study leads to better initiatives on query issuing and result viewing strategies for EBM related searches to improve the EBM process among practitioners.

Title: Improving Query Reformulation in Voice Search System

Abstract: During online search, users frequently modify the existing query to get better results. For voice search users, the system error is a second reason of query reformulation. In keyboard system, query reformulation usually involves partial modification which is not well supported by the current voice search systems. In this proposal, I aim to develop a set of voice commands which will improve the user experience in query reformulation during voice search. The study will include four phases. Firstly, a survey will be used to collect the user's perception of the current voice search system. Secondly, an experiment will be performed to find out how the users would like to communicate with the system. Thirdly, a set of voice commands will be developed based on the findings of the second phase. Finally, another experiment will be used to test the effects of the voice commands.

Title: Spoken Conversational Search: Speech-only Interactive Information Retrieval

Abstract: This research investigates a new interface paradigm for interactive information retrieval (IIR) which forces us to shift away from the classic "ten blue links" search engine results page. Instead we investigate how to present search results through a conversation over a speech-only communication channel where no screen is available. Accessing information via speech is becoming increasingly pervasive and is already important for people with a visual impairment. However, presenting search results over a speech-only communication channel is challenging due to cognitive limitations and the transient nature of audio. Studies have indicated that the implementation of speech recognizers and screen readers must be carefully designed and cannot simply be added to an existing system. Therefore the aim of this research is to develop a new interaction framework for effective and efficient IIR over a speech-only channel: a Spoken Conversational Search System (SCSS) which provides a conversational approach to defining user information needs, presenting results and enabling search reformulations. In order to contribute to a more efficient and effective search experience when using a SCSS, we intend for a tighter integration between document search and conversational processes.

Title: Investigating Information Search Behavior using Personal and Social Contextual Signals

Abstract: People have their behavioral patterns, through which they determine how to use, seek and share information. Also, the patterns interact with a person's intrinsic and extrinsic characteristics such as values, attitudes, social and cognitive capitals, affecting behaviors in different contexts and situations. Meanwhile, the emerging trends of smartphones and wearable computing allow for the creation of a rich user behavioral profile. Such a behavioral (personal, social, mobile, and cognitive) profile goes beyond traditional browser-based context and allows one's personality type and social capital to become pivotal indicators of search behavior. Through the multi-modal data analysis, I want to identify the correlations between different signal types as observed in everyday life information seeking contexts and predict individuals' search behavior using personal and social contextual signals.

Title: Exploring the Role of Culture in Online Searching Behavior from Cultural Cognition Perspective

Abstract: The purpose of this study is to identify if cultural differences affect information-searching behavior of users on Google with the use of eye tracking and mouse tracking technologies. Even though cultural differences and individual cognitive style have been the main concerns of several information behavior studies in the last 10 years, there are only a limited number of studies that investigate cognitive differences between online information seekers from cultural cognitive perspective. The theoretical framework of this study is driven from Vygotsky and Nisbett's theory of cultural cognition. According to this theory, culture has a significant impact on how we organize our thoughts and our relationships, how we perceive the world, and how we decide to behave and act. In this study, I aim to investigate if the theory of cultural cognition is applicable to the users' online information searching behavior.

Title: Understanding Users' Language Selection: Code-switching in Online Searches

Abstract: Non-native English users search for information on websites that mostly present content in English. There has been increasing concern as to whether web users who speak non-native English languages can access information as effectively as native English users. Few studies have been done on how multi-lingual users search for information in two or more languages online, specifically how they switch languages in order to get satisfying search results. This research investigates the factors that impact native Chinese users' code-switching (Chinese-English) search behaviors when they seek information online and the challenges that users encounter. The methods of this research consist of two phases. In-context interviews will allow us to explore natural behaviors in the users' context in the first phase. Fifteen native Chinese participants will be recruited. A controlled eye-tracking study is planned for the second phase in order to examine different reading patterns of these bilingual web users and what web elements they focus on. Thirty native Chinese will be recruited in this phase. The research aims to explore when, how, and why users switch languages, and examine the role of languages that users select in online searches.

Title: Nonlinear Composite Search Results

Abstract: Modern search engines aggregate information from a variety of sources (e.g. images, videos) and return this information to users, merged into a single results page. Various novel interface elements have been added to the results page to help users access diverse content, from interactive aggregated search blocks to contextual entity cards. These novel elements merge various types of media into coherent objects displayed on the results page. We define these elements as composite search results and study methods to construct them, as well as their effect on user search behaviour. Our findings suggest that result composition can be an effective search paradigm and that nonlinear composite results can positively impact search behaviour in certain contexts.

Title: Active and Passive Utility of Search Interface Features in Different Information Seeking Task Stages

Abstract: Models of information seeking, including Kuhlthau's Information Search Process model, describe fundamentally different macro-level stages. Current search systems usually do not provide support for these stages, but provide a static set of features predominantly focused on supporting micro-level search interactions. This paper investigates the utility of search user interface (SUI) features at different macro-level stages of complex tasks. A user study was designed, using simulated work tasks, to explicitly place users within different stages of a complex task: pre-focus, focus, and post-focus. Active use, passive use and perceived usefulness of features were analysed in order to derive when search features are most useful. Our results identify significant differences in the utility of SUI features between each stage. Specifically, we have observed that informational features are naturally useful in every stage, while input and control features decline in usefulness after the pre-focus stage, and personalisable features become more useful after the pre-focus stage. From these findings, we conclude that features less commonly found in web search interfaces can provide value for users, without cluttering simple searches, when provided at the right times.

Title: History by Diversity: Helping Historians search News Archives

Abstract: Longitudinal corpora like newspaper archives are of immense value to historical research, and time as an important factor for historians strongly influences their search behaviour in these archives. While searching for articles published over time, a key preference is to retrieve documents which cover the important aspects from important points in time which is different from standard search behavior. To support this search strategy, we introduce the notion of a Historical Query Intent to explicitly model a historian's search task and define an aspect-time diversification problem over news archives.We present a novel algorithm, HistDiv, that explicitly models the aspects and important time windows based on a historian's information seeking behavior. By incorporating temporal priors based on publication times and temporal expressions, we diversify both on the aspect and temporal dimensions. We test our methods by constructing a test collection based on The New York Times Collection with a workload of 30 queries of historical intent assessed manually. We find that HistDiv outperforms all competitors in subtopic recall with a slight loss in precision. We also present results of a qualitative user study to determine wether this drop in precision is detrimental to user experience. Our results show that users still preferred HistDiv's ranking.

Title: Interactive Topic Modeling for aiding Qualitative Content Analysis

Abstract: Topic Modeling algorithms are rarely used to support the qualitative content analysis process. The main contributing factors for the lack of mainstream adoption can be attributed to the perception that Topic Modeling produces topics of poor quality and that content analysts do not trust the derived topics because they are unable to supply domain knowledge and interact with the algorithm. In this paper, interactive Topic Modeling algorithms namely Dirichlet-Forrest Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Penalised Non-negative Matrix Factorisation, are evaluated with respect to their ability to aid qualitative content analysis. More specifically, the relationship between interactivity, interpretation, topic coherence and trust in interactive content analysis is examined. The findings indicate that providing content analysts with the ability to interact with Topic Modeling algorithms produces topics that are directly related to their research questions. However, a number of improvements to these algorithms were also identified which have the potential to influence future algorithm development to better meet the requirements of qualitative content analysts.

Title: Understanding User Satisfaction with Intelligent Assistants

Abstract: Voice-controlled intelligent personal assistants, such as Cortana, Google Now, Siri and Alexa, are increasingly becoming a part of users' daily lives, especially on mobile devices. They introduce a significant change in information access, not only by introducing voice control and touch gestures but also by enabling dialogues where the context is preserved. This raises the need for evaluation of their effectiveness in assisting users with their tasks. However, in order to understand which type of user interactions reflect different degrees of user satisfaction we need explicit judgements. In this paper, we describe a user study that was designed to measure user satisfaction over a range of typical scenarios of use: controlling a device, web search, and structured search dialogue. Using this data, we study how user satisfaction varied with different usage scenarios and what signals can be used for modeling satisfaction in the different scenarios. We find that the notion of satisfaction varies across different scenarios, and show that, in some scenarios (e.g. making a phone call), task completion is very important while for others (e.g. planning a night out), the amount of effort spent is key. We also study how the nature and complexity of the task at hand affects user satisfaction, and find that preserving the conversation context is essential and that overall task-level satisfaction cannot be reduced to query-level satisfaction alone. Finally, we shed light on the relative effectiveness and usefulness of voice-controlled intelligent agents, explaining their increasing popularity and uptake relative to the traditional query-response interaction.

Title: Contextual Support for Collaborative Information Retrieval

Abstract: Recent research shows that Collaborative Information Retrieval (CIR), in which two or more users collaborate on the same search task, has become increasingly popular. The presence of both search and collaboration behaviors makes CIR a complex search format, which further drives a critical need to understand CIR's search context. The contextual support for CIR should consider search contexts derived from both team members' search histories (including users' own search histories and partners' search histories) and their explicit collaboration (e.g., chatting). As it stands, existing studies on contextual search support only focus on Individual Information Retrieval (IIR) and only utilize individuals' own search histories. In this paper, we examine the unique search contexts (e.g., partners' search histories and team collaboration histories) in CIR. Based on a user study data collection with 54 participants, we find that compared to the use of individuals' own search histories, CIR contextual support is more effective when utilizing partners' search histories and teams' collaboration behaviors. More interestingly, though the explicit communication information (i.e., chat content) often involves massive noisy information, involving such noise does not affect the ranking of relevant documents since it also does not appear in relevant documents.

Title: User Experience Dimensions: A Systematic Approach to Experiential Qualities for Evaluating Information Interaction in Museums

Abstract: The present study develops a set of 10 dimensions based on a systematic understanding of the concept of experience as a holistic psychological. Seven of these are derived from a psychological conception of what experiencing and experiences are. Three supplementary dimensions spring from the observation that experiences apparently have become especially valuable phenomena in Western societies. The 10 dimensions are tried out in a field study at the Center for Art and Media (ZKM) in Germany with the purpose to study their applicability in the evaluation of interactive sound archives. 29 walk-alongs were carried out with 58 museums visitors. Our analysis showed that it was possible to identify the 10 experience dimensions in the study material. Some dimensions were expressed more frequently than others. The distribution of expressed dimensions and the content of the user comments provided a clear picture of how the two sound archives differed in respect to the experiential qualities.

Title: An AID for Avoiding Inadvertent Disclosure: Supporting Interactive Review for Privilege in E-Discovery

Abstract: When searching for evidence in civil litigation, parties to a lawsuit have the right to withhold some content on grounds of specific privileges that serve to foster socially desirable outcomes such as open communication between attorneys and their clients. As inadvertent disclosure of privileged content can adversely impact a client's interests, review for privilege is a high-stakes process that is most often performed manually. Because the circumstances in which privilege can be claimed are generally well defined, review for privilege is amenable to some degree of automation. This paper describes the design of an interactive system to support privilege review in which the goals are to improve the speed and accuracy of privilege review. Results are reported for a within-subjects study in which six reviewers with different levels of expertise examined email for attorney-client privilege or any other valid basis for withholding the content from release. Quantitative results indicate that substantial and statistically significant improvements in recall can be achieved, but no significant differences in average review speed were detected. Participants self-reported that the identity features exposed by the system were most useful to them, and that the present implementation of features based on content or date added no discernible additional value.

Title: A Usefulness-based Approach for Measuring the Local and Global Effect of IIR Services

Abstract: In Interactive Information Retrieval (IIR) different services such as search term suggestion can support users in their search process. The applicability and performance of such services is either measured with different user-centered studies (like usability tests or laboratory experiments) or, in the context of IR, with their contribution to measures like precision and recall. However, each evaluation methodology has its certain disadvantages. For example, user-centered experiments are often costly and small-scaled; IR experiments rely on relevance assessments and measure only relevance of documents. In this work we operationalize the usefulness model of Cole et al. (2009) on the level of system support to measure not only the local effect of an IR service, but the impact it has on the whole search process. We therefore use a log-based evaluation approach which models user interactions within sessions with positive signals and apply it for the case of a search term suggestion service. We found that the usage of the service significantly often implicates the occurrence of positive signals during the following session steps.

Title: Playing Your Cards Right: The Effect of Entity Cards on Search Behaviour and Workload

Abstract: In addition to merging results of different types (e.g.~images, videos, news items) into a ranked list of Web documents, modern search engines have also started displaying entity cards (ECs) on the results page. Entity cards are intended to enhance search experience in several ways: (i) they help searchers navigate diversified results, (ii) provide a summary of relevant content directly on the results page and (iii) support exploratory search by highlighting relevant entities associated with a given user query. We conducted a large-scale crowd-sourced user study, with more than $700$ unique searchers, to investigate the effects of entity cards on search behaviour and perceived workload. We find that the presence of ECs has a strong effect on both the way users interact with search results and their perceived task workload. Furthermore, by manipulating EC properties content, coherence and vertical diversity), we uncover different effects and interactions between card properties on measures of search behaviour and workload. Our study contributes an in-depth analysis of the effects of entity cards on user interaction with modern Web search interfaces.

Title: Behaviour Mining for Automatic Task-Keeping and Visualisations for Task-Refinding

Abstract: When people perform some tasks on their desktop, they tend to spend a considerable amount of time looking back, establishing past references and remembering. A task contains an evolving collection of documents to which the user is referring and that are relevant to the task. In the case of Web documents people tend to rely on their organisational skills and use a variety of "keeping" and "re-finding" tools which traditionally include bookmarks, history and search, amongst others. This paper reports the results of surveys conducted to investigate the way that people keep and re-find Web based tasks. As tasks can be interrupted or conducted over different sessions a user needs to keep, re-find, and resume them. A prototype called PiMxT is also presented, which uses an incremental density-based clustering approach to automatically generate and keep task-clusters by considering the user's window and tab switching, and re-visitation behaviour. The algorithm attempts to identify those documents that pertain to the same task-cluster, and also when a switch between two documents is effectively a task-switch. PiMxT allows for searching and filtering across the task-clusters as well as task-resumption through different visualisations. This tool was evaluated through a usability study and a questionnaire, and it was found that the time taken by the 15 participants to re-find and resume tasks was on average 44% less in 77% of the cases. Furthermore, although the participants expected PiMxT to be more complete and accurate they all recognised its usefulness.

Title: A Comparison of Primary and Secondary Relevance Judgements for Real-Life Topics

Abstract: The notion of relevance is fundamental to the field of Information Retrieval. Within the field a generally accepted conception of relevance as inherently subjective has emerged, with an individual's assessment of relevance influenced by numerous contextual factors. In this paper we present a user study that examines in detail the differences between primary and secondary assessors on a set of "real-world" topics which were gathered specifically for the work. By gathering topics which are representative of the staff and students at a major university, at a particular point in time, we aim to explore differences between primary and secondary relevance judgements for real-life search tasks. Findings suggest that while secondary assessors may find the assessment task challenging in various ways (they generally possess less interest and knowledge in secondary topics and take longer to assess documents), agreement between primary and secondary assessors is high.

Title: How Writers Search: Analyzing the Search and Writing Logs of Non-fictional Essays

Abstract: Many writers of non-fictional texts engage intensively in exploratory web search scenarios during their background research on the essay topic. Though understanding such search behavior is necessary for the development of search engines that specifically support writing tasks, it has neither been systematically recorded nor analyzed. This paper contributes part of the missing research: We report on the outcomes of a large-scale corpus construction initiative to acquire detailed interaction logs of writers who were given a writing task on 150 pre-defined TREC topics. The corpus is freely available to foster research on exploratory search. Each essay is at least 5000 words long and comes with a chronological log of search queries, result clicks, web browsing trails, and fine-grained writing revisions that reflect the task completion status. To ensure reproducibility, a fully-fledged, static web search environment has been created on top of the ClueWeb09 corpus as part of our initiative.In this paper, we present initial analyses of the recorded search interaction logs and overview insights gained from them: (1) essay writing behavior corresponds to search patterns that are rather stable for the same writer, (2) fact-checking queries often conclude a writing task, (3) recurring anchor queries are often submitted to not lose the main themes or to explore new directions, (4) query terms can be learned while searching and reading, (5) the number of submitted queries is not a good indicator for task completion.

Title: You Can Check It Out But It Will Never Leave: Characterising Ebook Borrowing Patterns

Abstract: What does it mean for a reader to borrow an ebook? Ebook technology means that borrowing can take different forms, for example printing and reading. We do not know, though, which of these options readers actually use. Ebook technology generates logs that allow us to understand ebook borrowing patterns over time, both by individual readers and in aggregate. Despite the ready availability of ebook logs, this area remains under-researched. In this paper we present an exploratory log analysis of ebook borrowing, comparing printing and reading, discovery patterns, single- and multiple-book sessions and identifying specific borrowing patterns.

Title: The Forgotten Needle in My Collections: Task-Aware Ranking of Documents in Semantic Information Space

Abstract: With the growing amount of content stored in personal and organizational information spaces, finding and re-finding documents becomes both more crucial and challenging. In this work, we propose an approach to reduce information overload in navigation by automatically focusing on important documents, adaptively to the tasks at hand. Based on the idea of managed forgetting, we present a ranking method, which unifies activity logs and semantic information about documents into a common framework to identify important documents to the user's current tasks. Our experiments on two real-world datasets, both collected from knowledge work activities in professional scenarios, show that our ranking approach outperforms the baseline methods for both subsequent access prediction and the effectiveness in ranking important documents. Furthermore, we implemented and demonstrated a system for decluttering information spaces as a proof of concept of our managed forgetting approach.

Title: Assessing Learning Outcomes in Web Search: A Comparison of Tasks and Query Strategies

Abstract: Users make frequent use of Web search for learning-related tasks, but little is known about how different Web search interaction strategies affect outcomes for learning-oriented tasks, or what implicit or explicit indicators could reliably be used to assess search-related learning on the Web. We describe a lab-based user study in which we investigated potential indicators of learning in web searching, effective query strategies for learning, and the relationship between search behavior and learning outcomes. Using questionnaires, analysis of written responses to knowledge prompts, and search log data, we found that searchers' perceived learning outcomes closely matched their actual learning outcomes; that the amount searchers wrote in post-search questionnaire responses was highly correlated with their cognitive learning scores; and that the time searchers spent per document while searching was also highly and consistently correlated with higher-level cognitive learning scores. We also found that of the three query interaction conditions we applied, an intrinsically diverse presentation of results was associated with the highest percentage of users achieving combined factual and conceptual knowledge gains. Our study provides deeper insight into which aspects of search interaction are most effective for supporting superior learning outcomes, and the difficult problem of how learning may be assessed effectively during Web search.

Title: The Information Network: Exploiting Causal Dependencies in Online Information Seeking

Abstract: The Internet has emerged as a leading source of information about the world and its daily occurrences. Platforms like Wikipedia act as information conduits through which informational elements (e.g. topic pages) cater to the information seeking needs of users worldwide. While usage data from these informational elements help us to predict the information seeking behavior of users, especially in reaction to external news events, what has been largely ignored in past literature is the predictive value of the underlying informational network that connects these elements. In this study, we uncover causal linkages in information seeking behavior among related informational elements on Wikipedia. We demonstrate that incorporating this causal information leads to better predictions of page view counts of relevant Wikipedia pages, when compared to models that ignore such underlying causal linkages. We also provide additional evidence about the efficacy of our approach from the real world, by performing a judgment study with human annotators. This research is among the first to investigate and uncover the value of understanding the underlying relationships among informational elements.

Title: Investigating the Role of User Engagement in Digital Reading Environments

Abstract: User engagement is recognized as an important component of the user experience, but relatively little is known about the effect of engagement on the learning outcomes of such interactions. This experimental user study examines the relationship between user engagement (UE) and comprehension in varied academic reading environments. Forty-one university students interacted with one of two sets of texts presented in 4 conditions in the context of preparing for a class assignment. Employing the User Engagement Scale (UES), we found evidence of a relationship between students' comprehension of the texts and their degree of engagement with them. However, this association was confined to one of the UES subscales and was not consistent across levels of engagement. An examination of additional variables found little evidence that system and content characteristics influenced engagement; however, we noted that all students' reported increased knowledge, but topical interest for non-engaged students declined. Results contribute to existing literature by adding further evidence that the relationship between engagement and comprehension is complex and mediated.

Title: Impacts of Time Constraints and System Delays on User Experience

Abstract: During information search, people often experience time pressure. This might be a result of a deadline, the system's performance or some other event. In this paper, we report results of a study with forty-five participants which investigated how time constraints and system delays impacted the user experience during information search. We randomly assigned half of our study participants to a treatment condition where they were only allowed five minutes per search task (the other half were given no time limits). For half of participants' search tasks, five second delays were introduced after queries were submitted and SERP results were clicked. We used multilevel modeling to evaluate a number of hypotheses about the effects of time constraint, system delays and user experience. We found those in the time constraint condition reported significantly greater time pressure, experienced higher task difficulty, less satisfaction with their performance, increased importance of working fast and engaged in more metacognitive monitoring. We found when experiencing system delays participants reported slower system speeds when encountering delays on the second task. This work opens a new line of inquiry into how time pressure impacts the search experience and how tools and interfaces might be designed to support people who are searching under time pressure. It also presents an example of how multilevel modeling can be used to better understand and model the complex interactions that occur during interactive information retrieval.

Title: (The Lack of) Privacy Concerns with Sharing Web Activity at Work and the Implications for Collaborative Search

Abstract: Collaborative information seeking frequently occurs in an opportunistic and loosely-coupled fashion that is supported by awareness of others' activities on the web. Automatically sharing traces of information about web activity could substantially improve these collaborative information tasks, but conventional wisdom suggests that people are very reluctant to share information about web usage. Because work settings have different rules and practices about privacy, we carried out the first systematic study of people's privacy concerns about sharing web activity within workgroups. To provide a better understanding of privacy concerns about sharing web activity at work, we conducted a two-week diary study with 18 participants. Our study system asked participants to report on their search tasks and privacy concerns. Surprisingly, our results showed that people have little concern about sharing the majority of their activities with their work colleagues, and had even fewer concerns with sharing work-related activities. Our results provide new insights into the possibilities of sharing web activities within workgroups, and provide evidence that tools based on automatic sharing of awareness information can be feasible.

Title: Exploring the Use of Query Auto Completion: Search Behavior and Query Entry Profiles

Abstract: Query auto completion (QAC) is nearly ubiquitous in modern search systems, however, there are few published studies on how searchers use QAC query suggestions. This study describes the use of QAC by 29 searchers working on eight assigned search topics in a lab setting. We found that our subjects had differing propensities to use QAC, with some searchers rarely using it, while others used QACs for about half their queries. This study extends prior work by examining the use of QAC in the context of whole search sessions across multiple topics, and by comparing search behavior and visual attention for queries that used QAC and those that did not. The study concludes with an exploration of differences in QAC usage and query behavior among searchers, which reveals six possible query entry profiles.

Title: What Affects Word Changes in Query Reformulation During a Task-based Search Session?

Abstract: This paper performs an analysis on the influence of different factors on users' choices of specific word changes in query reformulation during a search session. We study three types of word changes: whether to remove or retain a word in the current query; whether or not to add a brand-new word to the query; whether or not to reuse a word (included in previous queries, but removed in the current query). Three types of factors are examined: session-level factors measuring task and user characteristics; query-level factors related to past user activities in a session; word-level factors for the characteristics of the examined word and its relation to the current query and search results. Statistical analysis suggests that: word-level factors strongly influence all three types of word changes; query-level factors only show a clear influence on retaining or removing a word; task-level factors exhibit limited direct influence on all three types of word changes. Analysis also disclose reasons for different word changes: users remove a word to stop exploring a subtask, or to correct bad performing queries; they look for related, unused words from recently viewed result summaries and add to queries; reusing a word usually indicates reverting from a subtask to the main task or another subtask.

Title: Deepening the Role of the User: Neuro-Physiological Evidence as a Basis for Studying and Improving Search

Abstract: In this paper, the potential for expanding the set of scientific evidence and insights associated with the users' role during the search process is explored. As it is intended to be a position paper and not a systematic survey, a comprehensive review of literature is not presented here. However, the authors draw on some early stage research, in this emerging area, to describe and explain the generation of neuro-physiological evidence using three types of modalities. The modalities and the associated methods described here, presented in order of increasing complexity, include Eye-tracking, EEG, and fMRI. The paper concludes with a few critical observations regarding the promises and perils of using neuro-physiological approaches in studying search and search behavior.

Title: Video Test Collection with Graded Relevance Assessments

Abstract: Relevance is a complex, but core, concept within the field of Information Retrieval. In order to allow system comparisons the many factors that influence relevance are often discarded to allow abstraction to a single score relating to relevance. This means that a great wealth of information is often discarded. In this paper we outline the creation of a video test collection with graded relevance assessments, to the best of our knowledge the first example of such a test collection for video retrieval. To directly address the shortcoming above we also gathered behavioural and perceptual data from assessors during the assessment process. All of this information along with judgements are available for download. Our intention is to allow other researchers to supplement the judgements to help create an adaptive test collection which contains supplementary information rather than a completely static collection with binary judgements.

Title: Modeling Optimal Switching Behavior

Abstract: Recently developed retrieval effectiveness measures have incorporated models of user behavior, but have limited themselves to predicting user performance over a single query and response. Accurate prediction of user performance with search systems must incorporate a means to model how users switch between different information sources. For example, a search session may consist of multiple queries with the user making decisions of when to switch from evaluating the current result list to a new result list produced by a query reformulation. Likewise, users may switch to a result list produced by a query suggestion or other interaction mechanism that produces a new search result list. In this paper, we simulate user behavior and investigate optimal switching behavior for a user who must decide when and if to issue their current query to another search engine. As a first step in understanding the problem space, we restrict our investigation and discussion to two top performing runs submitted to the TREC 2005 Robust track. We find four classes of switching behavior that a user would be faced with in making a decision about whether to switch from one result list to another.

Title: On Identifying the Bounds of an Internet Resource

Abstract: Systems for retrieving or archiving Internet resources often assume a URI acts as a delimiter for the resource. But there are many situations where Internet resources do not have a one-to-one mapping with URIs. For URIs that point to the first page of a document that has been broken up over multiple pages, users are likely to consider the whole article as the resource, even though it is spread across multiple URIs. Comments, tags, ratings, and advertising might or might not be perceived as part of the resource whether they are retrieved as part of the primary URI or accessed via a link. Similarly, whether content accessible via links, tabs, or other navigation available at the primary URI is perceived as part of the resource may depend on the design of the website. We are examining what people believe are the bounds of Internet resources with the hope of informing systems that better match user perceptions. To understand this challenge we explore a situation where the user is assumed to have identified a resource by a URI, particularly for archiving. To begin to answer these questions, we asked 110 participants how desirable it would be for web contents related to an identified archived resource to also be archived. Results indicate that the features important to this decision likely vary considerably from resource to resource.

Title: Developing a Measure of Search Expertise

Abstract: While search expertise has long been considered an important variable in the study of online information search, the creation of a robust measure to characterize it has eluded researchers. Instead, those wishing to measure search expertise often include a single item that asks people to indicate how often they search or for how long they have been searching. In this paper, we report initial results of a four-phase study aimed at developing a measure of search expertise. Interviews and focus groups were conducted with nine professional searchers and an inventory of items related to online search expertise was created. While participants identified a number of usual items for determining search expertise, such as prior search experience, domain knowledge and resource knowledge, they also identified a large number of items related to personality characteristics such as persistence, flexibility, curiosity, adaptability and humility. These results suggest that measuring personality characteristics in addition to experience and knowledge might help determine who will be a more successful searcher. In today's search environments, where many people describe themselves as experts, representing these types of characteristics in a measure of search expertise might allow researchers and practitioners to observe more variation in populations of interest, design more effective instruction and make better predictions about search outcomes.

Title: Usability Evaluation of Electronic Health Record System (EHRs) using Subjective and Objective Measures

Abstract: The objective of this pilot study was to explore the applicability of various evaluation methods (subjective and objective) for assessing usability of electronic health record system (EHRs) during physician interaction on simple vs. complex tasks. Five physicians performed two simulated clinical scenarios consisting of 9 tasks using the EHR. Tasks were categorized into simple vs. complex tasks based on the user, task and context characteristics by the subject matter expert. Usability was assessed using four methods, (1) subjectively using subject's informal feedback and usability expert's heuristics, (2) workload measures using eye tracking, (3) behavior measures using clicks and navigation windows, and (4) performance measures using actual time on task and predictive time based on CogTool ©. Overall, the results suggest that heuristic methods (1) are highly effective in identifying usability issues, with other methods (2-4) providing complementary analysis to identify differences is task complexly and user experience with EHRs.

Title: The Role of the Unconscious in Information Retrieval: What User Perception Tells Us

Abstract: Increasing evidence from psychoanalytic and psychodynamic research suggests that the unconscious influences our daily decisions, and psychologists have suggested that as much as 85-95% of decision making occurs outside our conscious awareness. For information science, it is important to understand how these unconscious processes play a role in information seeking. The current study uses subliminal psychodynamic activation (SPA), through the use of subliminal messages that appeared below the threshold of conscious awareness, to investigate the influence of the unconscious in information searching. Twenty-four college students participated in a controlled laboratory experiment, each searching freely on the Internet for information for three search tasks, with various SPA messages appearing in each search. Participants were systematically assigned to one of the four SPA conditions with various subliminal messages. Users' perceptions of search task topic interest, topic knowledge and task difficulty was examined between different SPA conditions, as well as the change of users' perceptions on topic interest, knowledge, and difficulty before and after searching in different SPA conditions. Findings suggested that users' pre- and post-task ratings of topic interest, knowledge, and difficulty did not show significant differences among the 4 SPA conditions. However, the change in users' perceptions of topic interest and topic knowledge before and after searching showed significant differences when SPA messages were present. Our findings inspire future research in this underexplored field.

Title: Vapor Engine: Demonstrating an Early Prototype of a Language-Independent Search Engine for Speech

Abstract: Typical search engines for spoken content begin with some form of language-specific audio processing such as phonetic word recognition. Many languages, however, lack the language tuned preprocessing tools that are needed to create indexing terms for speech. One approach in such cases is to rely on repetition, detected using acoustic features, to find terms that might be worth indexing. Experiments have shown that this approach yields term sets that might be sufficient for some applications in both spoken term detection and ranked retrieval experiments. Such approaches currently work only with spoken queries, however, and only when the searcher is able to speak in a manner similar to that of the speakers in the collection. This demonstration paper proposes Vapor Engine, a new tool for selectively transcribing repeated terms that can be automatically detected from spoken content in any language. These transcribed terms could then be matched to queries formulated using written terms. Vapor Engine is early in development: it currently supports only single-term queries and has not yet having been formally evaluated. This paper introduces the interface and summarizes the challenges it seeks to address.

Title: Measuring Engagement with Online Forms

Abstract: Online form-filling and transactions are extremely common, both for industry and government; and it is important to provide a satisfying user experience during these tasks if customers or citizens are to continue using online channels. However, reliable measures of experience in these cases are limited. Other areas of information interaction, e.g., online search, news, and shopping, are increasingly exploring and attempting to measure the concept of user engagement (UE). In this study, we ask whether UE is an appropriate outcome for the utilitarian activities of online form-filling and transactions.We describe work in progress which measures UE using the User Engagement Scale (UES) with utilitarian tasks, and which looks for behaviours which correlate with the UES. Early results suggest that, first, the UES can be adapted to such situations; and second, that readily observable user behaviours including time on site, mouse movements, and keypresses correlate with UES sub-scales and can, to some extent, predict users' responses.

Title: Individual Differences and Online Health Information Source Selection

Abstract: Online information sources are become increasingly diverse. The selection of sources for health information has significant implications for people's healthcare decision-making. However, little is known about how individual differences influence users' selection of online sources for health information. This study intends to fill this gap by exploring the impact of a number of individual characteristics on users' selection of five online sources (search engines, social Q&A sites, social networking sites (SNSs), online health communities, and crowdsourcing sites) for three distinct types of health-related search task (factual, exploratory, and personal experiences). We found that individuals' health literacy and frequency of using a source are the most significant predictors of their source selections across task types. Preference for information has an impact on users' selection of SNSs for exploratory tasks. Extraversion personality has an impact on users' selection of search engines for tasks that seek personal experiences. Nevertheless, demographic factors, including gender, income, and health status, do not predict users' selection of online sources for health information.

Title: The Role of Language Skills in Interactive Social Book Search Sessions

Abstract: When searching for books, people frequently have to deal with content that is in a language different from their own. However, research on multilingual systems has generally focused on the user interface's language rather than the content language. In this paper, we describe and compare early results from the multilingual aspects in the Interactive Social Book Search (iSBS) task at CLEF 2014 and 2015. A preliminary analysis of usage patterns for native English and non-native English speakers indicates an influence of language skills on search behaviour during goal-oriented and casual leisure tasks. Based on previous experiences and results, strengths and challenges of IIR studies are discussed.

Title: Rationale and Architecture for Incorporating Human Oculomotor Plant Features in User Interest Modeling

Abstract: We present a conceptual framework expanding the use of eye movement as a source of implicit relevance feedback. While gaze time has been the primary feature to be incorporated in interest modeling, this work constructs a model of human oculomotor plant features during user's interaction with multiple everyday applications with the goal of better interpreting user gaze data. The following presents the anatomical reasoning behind incorporating additional gaze features, the integration of the additional features into an existing interest modeling architecture, and a plan for assessing the impact of the addition of the features.

Title: TwIST: A Mobile Approach for Searching and Exploring within Twitter

Abstract: Popular user-generated content services like Twitter have made it easy for people to post and browse short messages while on the go. However, the ability to search is limited by the query box and search results list paradigm. In this paper, we propose TwIST (Twitter Information Search Tool), which has been designed to support interactive search and exploration within Twitter. TwIST is a mobile application that works in two modes: simple search and exploratory search. The searcher can easily change between these modes by rotating the device, making it easy to access the mode that will support the desired search activity. While the simple search mode is dominated by the common search results list format, the exploratory search mode uses topic modelling, visualization, and interactive filtering to support the searcher in finding the information they are seeking.

Title: Are Secondary Assessors Uncertain When They Disagree About Relevance Judgements?

Abstract: The collection of relevance judgements by assessors is important for many information retrieval (IR) tasks. In addition to the construction of test collections, relevance judging is critical to e-discovery and other applications where many assessors are hired to perform relevance judging. It is well known that assessors may differ in their judgements for a given document. One possible cause of a judgement difference is that an assessor may be uncertain in their judgement and thus may in effect be guessing the document's relevance. If assessors are aware of their uncertainty and can self-report their level of certainty, then uncertain relevance judgements can be targeted for adjudication by additional assessors. In this paper, we conducted a user study with 48 participants to test our hypothesis that assessors will be uncertain about their relevance judgements when the assessors are likely to disagree with each other. We found that for low consensus documents, i.e. documents known for assessor disagreement, assessors judge these documents with almost as much certainty as high consensus documents. In particular, assessor self-reported uncertainty is predictive of disagreement only for high consensus documents and not for low consensus documents.

Title: Manipulating Time Perception of Web Search Users

Abstract: Time is an important factor in information retrieval studies including search evaluation, user behavior analysis and query understanding. In most of the previous works, time is usually an objective factor measured by timing devices. However, the time perceived by user seems more intuitive to describe the impact of time because search user's opinion is considered subjective. Psychological researches have reported that time perception can be affected by many physical and psychological factors. In this work, a laboratory study with 50 participants was adopted to investigate the impact of Temporal Relevance, e.g., the awareness of elapsed time, on time perception of Web search users. Experimental results show that participants in high temporal relevance environments tend to perceive significantly longer task durations than the actual ones. It shows that the perception of time can be manipulated in Web search scenario and reveals the necessity to take the factor of user perception into consideration in time-related Web search researches such as effort-based evaluation.

Title: Exploring the Benefits of 2D Visualizations for Drum Samples Retrieval

Abstract: This paper explores the potential benefits of using similarity-based two-dimensional classifications and their corresponding GUIs, for drum samples retrieval in a creativity-oriented context. Preliminary user studies with professional electronic music producers point up the frustration and laboriousness of finding suitable drum samples in the increasingly large libraries of sounds available, and suggest the need for alternative interfaces and approaches. To address this issue, two novel spatial visualizations (respectively organized by name and by timbre-similarity) are designed as potential alternatives to the traditional 1D list-based browsers. These visualizations are implemented and compared in a music creation task, in terms of both the exploration experience and the resulting production quality, within a system for drum kit configuration. Our study shows that spatial visualizations do improve the overall exploration experience, and reveals the potential of similarity-based arrangements for the support of creative processes.

Title: How does Interest in a Work Task Impact Search Behavior and Engagement?

Abstract: One goal of using simulated work tasks in interactive information retrieval (IIR) experiments is to create a more relevant and interesting search experience for study participants. However, there is not much guidance about how to identify interesting tasks or how interest in a task impacts search behaviors and experiences, which is the purpose of this study. In this study, we created eight work tasks and asked forty participants to rank these tasks from most interesting to least interesting before they came into the lab for an IIR experiment. During the experiment, we asked participants to conduct searches for the two tasks they ranked as most interesting and the two they ranked as least interesting. Participants completed pre- and post-search questionnaires to characterize their interests in the tasks and their search experiences, including engagement. Participants rated their interest, prior knowledge and search experience, and the relevancy of interesting tasks significantly higher than uninteresting tasks. They also predicted these tasks would be significantly less difficult to complete. Participants reported significantly greater engagement with interesting tasks and they spent longer completing these tasks. However, there were no significant differences in participants' search behaviors including number of queries issued, number of SERPs, or number of documents bookmarked. These results provide evidence that our method of assigning tasks to participants that would interest and engage them, at least cognitively, if not behaviorally, was somewhat successful. This method can be used by others conducting laboratory IIR studies.

Title: Evaluating Body-Centered Interactions in an Image Search Task

Abstract: Interacting with information in digital environments involves a physical gap between people and information. Although current advances in interaction technology provide the means for helping bridge this gap, little is known about whether this gap affects user experience and performance in the context of information-related tasks such as information search. In this paper we present preliminary results from a larger study focused on immersive interaction with digital information objects. In particular, we report those derived from a user study designed to evaluate interactions with digital information objects through body gestures in the context of an image search task. Our results suggest that compared to traditional interactions through mouse, this type of interaction not only helps lessen cognitive workload, but also leads to achieve similar precision in terms of the information collected.

Title: Category Oriented Task Extraction

Abstract: With increasing amounts of digital content, users can accomplish complex tasks online, thus making task extraction from query logs an active area of research. Recently, some approaches have proposed entity based extraction of tasks, where they either use entities as features or construct task dictionaries that contain multiple tasks. While text based features do not exploit entities directly, task dictionaries do not provide concise or distinct representation of tasks. We overcome these shortcomings by extracting category oriented tasks by exploiting properties of an existing, publicly available category hierarchy. We evaluate quality of these tasks with implicit, explicit and application based evaluation. Empirical evaluation shows that category based task extraction results in more accurate and useful tasks.

Title: Evaluating Touch-Based Interactions in an Image Search Task

Abstract: Current technologies provide users different ways to interact with digital content, nevertheless, a physical gap between these two interaction components exists. In particular, touch-based interfaces enable users to use their own fingers to manipulate and interact with digital objects in a more direct fashion than mouse-based interactions. However, it is not clear yet to what extent, if any, this type of interaction could help bridge the gap between users and the digital world in particular information-related contexts such as information search. In this paper we report preliminary results of a user study designed to compare mouse and touch-based interactions in the context of an image search task. This study is part of a larger research project focused on immersive interaction with digital information objects. Our results show that in spite of the novelty, high adoption rates, and tangible nature of touch-based interfaces, no significant differences exist with prevalent technology (i.e., mouse) in terms of performance; nevertheless, user experience was found to better in touch-based interactions.

Title: A Spoken Dialog System for Coordinating Information Consumption and Exploration

Abstract: Passive consumption of information is boring in most cases and even painful in some cases, especially when the information content is delivered by employing speech media. The user of a speech-based information delivery system, for example a text-to-speech system, usually cannot interrupt the ongoing information flow, inhibiting her/him to confirm some part of the content, or to pose an inquiry for further information exploration. We argue that a carefully designed spoken dialog system could remedy these undesirable situations, and further enable an enjoyable conversation with the users. The key technologies to realize such an attractive dialog system are: (1) pre-compilation of a dialog plan based on the analysis of a source content, and (2) the dynamic recognition of user's state of understanding and interests. This paper illustrates technical views to implement these functionalities, and discusses a dialog example to exemplify the technical merits of the proposed system.

Title: Effects of Topic Familiarity on Query Reformulation Strategies

Abstract: Users employ various Query Reformulation (QR) Strategies to improve their search experiences as well as to retrieve the better results. In this exploratory research, we investigate the association of topic familiarities with such QR strategies. We design a user study where 38 participants with different levels of Topic Familiarity (TF) took part in the TREC Genomics Search Track (a total of five search tasks). We conducted two experiments: 1) we evaluate a set of predefined QR strategies to discover if participants with a specific level of TF tends to use a specific QR strategy. 2) we propose a supervised classification system that classifies consecutive queries made by the participants with different levels (low, medium, and high) of topic familiarity. Various lexical and distributional semantic features are implemented and feature analysis shows that participants with low familiarity tend to alter the spelling and use stemming for QR whereas participants with medium or higher familiarity are inclined to add new terms and phrases to reformulate queries.

Title: Factor Analysis of a Search Self-Efficacy Scale

Abstract: Participants in information search studies are often asked to characterize their search expertise using questionnaires provided by researchers. These questionnaires often contain ad hoc sets of items in part because there are no valid and reliable measures of search experience. In this paper, we present results of an exploratory factor analysis of 327 responses to a 14-item Search Self-Efficacy scale (SSE) that we have been using as a way to measure search experience in our research. The responses come from eight different interactive information retrieval (IIR) studies, which we have conducted over the last six years, with a variety of participant types: university students, participants from the general adult population and crowd-sourced participants. The purpose of this analysis is to understand the variation in search self-efficacy scores across different types of people and to evaluate the potential of the SSE scale as a tool for measuring search experience. Overall, participants from all eight studies reported similar levels of search self-efficacy; the overall average from all eight studies was 7.47 (items scored on a 10-point scale) with little variance (standard deviation=1.36). Both the lowest and highest scores (7.1 and 7.8) were observed in studies involving the general adult population. A factor analysis showed that the questionnaire items load onto six factors, although only four had sufficient numbers of items loading on them. These four factors represent overall task success, effective use of time, query development skills, and advanced search skills.

Title: Correlation Between System and User Metrics in a Session

Abstract: We investigate the correlations between system-oriented evaluation metrics and a few user experience metrics for a search session. The system-oriented metrics include session-based DCG (sDCG), normalized sDCG (nsDCG), estimated session nDCG (esNDCG), and a few variants of these metrics. We also look into statistics (e.g., the mean, maximum, and minimum values) of individual queries' nDCG scores, as well as the first and the last query's nDCG in a session. These system-oriented metrics are compared with users' self-rated search performance and task difficulty for a session. Experimental results show that nsDCG and esNDCG have reasonable but weak correlations with the user metrics, while the worst and the last query's nDCG in a session have comparably strong correlations. This suggests future work may better measure users' search experience in a session by modeling each query in the session differently.

Title: Characterizing Users' Multi-Tasking Behavior in Web Search

Abstract: Multi-tasking within a single online search sessions is an increasingly popular phenomenon. In this work, we quantify multi-tasking behavior of web search users. Using insights from large-scale search logs, we seek to characterize user groups and search sessions with a focus on multi-task sessions. Our findings show that dual-task sessions are more prevalent than single-task sessions in online search, and that over 50\% of search sessions have more than 2 tasks. Further, we provide a method to categorize users into focused, multi-taskers or supertaskers depending on their level of task-multiplicity and show that the search effort expended by these users varies across the groups. The findings from this analysis provide useful insights about task-multiplicity in an online search environment and hold potential value for search engines that wish to personalize and support search experiences of users based on their task behavior.

Title: Generalized Group Profiling for Content Customization

Abstract: There is an ongoing debate on personalization, adapting results to the unique user exploiting a user's personal history, versus customization, adapting results to a group profile sharing one or more characteristics with the user at hand. Personal profiles are often sparse, due to cold start problems and the fact that users typically search for new items or information, necessitating to back-off to customization, but group profiles often suffer from accidental features brought in by the unique individual contributing to the group. In this paper we propose a generalized group profiling approach that teases apart the exact contribution of the individual user level and the `abstract' group level by extracting a latent model that captures all, and only, the essential features of the whole group. Our main findings are the followings.First, we propose an efficient way of group profiling which implicitly eliminates the general and specific features from users' models in a group and takes out the abstract model representing the whole group.Second, we employ the resulting models in the task of contextual suggestion. We analyse different grouping criteria and we find that group-based suggestions improves the customization. Third, we see that the granularity of groups affects the quality of group profiling. We observe that grouping approach should compromise between the level of customization and groups' size.

Title: Effects of Position and Time Bias on Understanding Onsite Users' Behavior

Abstract: The existence of different biases in logged users' behavior makes it difficult to extract realistic topical and social information from users' interaction logs (e.g., query logs). To understand users' behavior and their interests in the cultural heritage domain, we have logged onsite user interaction logs of visits in a museum. This prompts the question on the reliability of the social information being gathered from the onsite logs: How does the position of museum objects affect users' behavior in the museum? How does order of visiting point of interests affect their dwell-time in front of each point of interest? How do different users' characteristics affect their behavior in the museum? In short, what are different kinds of biases that should be considered in the onsite logs? Our main findings are the following: First, there is a considerable position bias, which is due to the design of the exhibition and should be considered during extraction of social signals from the log. Second, there is a bias in the amount of time that users spend for interacting with the point of interests and the order of picking them to visit. This shows a fatigue on users' interactions while they are reaching to the end of the exhibition. Third, we find out some variations among the users' visit, which shows context is an important factor to consider while using onsite logs for different purposes.

Title: Information (Re)Use in Context

Abstract: Over the last 25-30 years, an enormous amount has been learned about how people seek, use, maintain, and reuse information and expertise in groups and other collectivities. We have also seen major changes in the kinds of information available and in how it is available.I believe we're on the cusp of the next generation of computational environments and user experiences. It goes under many names - pervasive environments, Internet of Things, Big Data, ubicomp, and on and on - but what is clear is that things are about to change for information - and for users.This talk considers some of the changes that might occur, grounding them in current work - then and tries to find the new roles and characteristics that search and information seeking will have. (Spoiler Alert: search and seeking will more tightly intertwine.).

Title: Interactive Information Retrieval: An Evaluation Perspective

Abstract: This presentation addresses methodological issues of interactive information retrieval (IIR) evaluation in terms of what it entails to study users' use and interaction with IR systems, as well as their satisfaction with retrieved information. In particular, the presentation focuses on test design, and it takes a look into the toolbox of IIR test design with reference to data collection methods and test procedure. It calls for careful and well-planned studies to qualify the knowledgebase generated as a result of the conducted IIR studies. The presentation further reflects on the need for an updated theoretical framework to describe partly the various types of IIR, and partly how IIR nowadays often is carried out in a seamless task switching IT environment on various platforms, including via apps. This type of environment furthermore calls for new methodologies to study the IIR behaviour in the habitat of the users to ensure a complete and realistic picture to enhance our understanding of IIR.The presentation also reflects on whether a re-thinking of the concept on an information need is necessary. One may ask whether it still makes sense to talk about types of information needs. Or should we rather study IIR from the perspective of search dedication and task load in order to also include everyday life information seeking?With this presentation, the IIR community is invited to an exchange of ideas and is encouraged to engage in collaborations with the solving of these (and other) issues to our joint advantage.

Title: SEADE Workshop Proposal - The Serendipity Factor: Evaluating the Affordances of Digital Environments

Abstract: For two decades, research has sought to understand serendipity and how it may be facilitated in digital environments such as information visualizations systems, search systems, and social media. The motivation to support serendipity comes from its association with positive outcomes that range from personal benefits to global rewards. To date, research has made significant headway in defining and mapping the process of serendipity and new tools are emerging to support it. Creative and robust heuristics and methods of evaluation, however, are required to help move the research forward, to ensure that new or enhanced features, functions, or tools are providing affordances as intended. Without sound approaches, we are blind as to what facilitates serendipity and proposed heuristics to aid practitioners are speculative. SEADE (pronounced 'seed') is a one-day workshop that will examine how we balance the tension between diversity and novelty in designing digital environments and subsequently how we evaluate the 'serendipitousness' of those environments. Since 2006, in its earlier iterations as IIiX and HCIR, CHIIR has served as a venue for the discussion of user-centred information interaction in context. CHIIR provides an ideal venue for bringing together researchers from diverse information and computer science communities and beyond working on the problem of providing support for serendipity in digital environments.

Title: Teaching Teachers and Making Makers: What the Maker Movement Can Teach the World about Accessibility and Design

Abstract: Although interactive technologies and the maker movement offer stunning prospects for the next 50 years of educational inclusion and accessibility for learners with visual disabilities, a surprising array of physical, digital, and cultural barriers continue to communicate lessons of exclusion and inequity. Accessibility is a fundamental aspect of digital and physical design which, when present, allows a user with a disability to have an effective and substantively equivalent experience to that of a user without a disability. Here we consider interaction barriers for people with visual disabilities, but the themes readily apply to other disability-specific challenges in universal design and inclusion.Consider any cross section of exciting instructional technologies, and chances are they are dominated by visual metaphors, graphical user interfaces, data visualizations, and interactive video. Systems that incorporate ostensibly non-visual, multi-modal interactives such as haptics and active manipulation do not necessarily expand access for blind and visually-impaired learners, as such tools are likely also to include key interface elements that are visual.The same may be said of mainstream information technologies accessibility is still temperamental and far from complete for such seemingly simple and ubiquitous resources as Google Suite, Facebook, and YouTube, let alone advanced immersive experiences such as Oculus Rift. The iconic tools of the maker movement and experiential learning -- 3D design, modeling, and printing -- while lauded and enthusiastically embraced by sighted designers of accessible instructional materials, remain largely unusable by independent blind makers.

Title: Crazy Like Us: Design for Vulnerable Populations

Abstract: Most ethics boards classify children as a vulnerable population -- all children. The reason given for this is that children lack the necessary cognitive capacity to decide whether or not to participate in most research. It may be difficult for them to foresee the risks and potential benefits to their own well-being or to understand how the conditions of research may or may not be in their own best interests. Children who have special challenges, such as those with dyslexia, ADHD, developmental delays, or mental health issues, or children living in poverty, who may be illiterate or repressed, may have even less capacity to understand and give assent to participate in research. Working with and for children, which is the cornerstone of the child-computer interaction community, raises a number of ethical challenges. First, we must present our research to children in ways they can understand. Because if we don't do this then we exclude the children who could benefit the most from the work we do, because they cannot easily give assent or because they may be difficult to access or work with. This raises an even more important issue. We may think that children can benefit from participating in our research or from using the computational systems that result from our research. But is this true? How do we know if the children we study are benefiting from our research? Third, what happens after our research is over? What legacy do we leave behind when our research is complete?

Title: What If Your Project's Timeline is a 100 Years?: Reflections on Computational Literacies

Abstract: What could it mean to have a project with goals that take decades or even a century to realize? In this talk, I reflect on my own intention to work toward a genuinely new and deep literacy-computational literacy--which I would place in eventual impact about halfway between algebra/calculus (as a literacy) and the root prototype, mass literacy centered on written text.I start by explaining what I mean by computational literacy and what experiences have concretized it for me and made it an attractive and plausible goal. Because of its nature as a cultural phenomenon, a literacy can only be achieved by a long and meandering path of social genesis. I illustrate the nature of such development with phenomena-cultural memes, movements, sensitivities, and values (MMSVs)--as they influence development. Example MMSVs include "computational thinking" as construed by the computer science community, and the widespread current popularity of "coding academies." Finally, I position some of the best modern allies in the quest for computational literacy--such as constructionism and computer modeling--in what I take to be the larger frame: the development of a true computational literacy.

Title: System And User Centered Evaluation Approaches in Interactive Information Retrieval (SAUCE 2016)

Abstract: The purpose of this half-day workshop is to bring together academic and industry interactive information retrieval (IIR) researchers with an interest in evaluation methodologies. The workshop articulates contemporary challenges in the investigation of IIR and invites user- and system-oriented researchers to work collaboratively to address these challenges by combining user- and system-centered methodologies in meaningful ways. We anticipate that this workshop will initiate productive knowledge exchange and partnerships that can respond to the increasing user, task, system, and contextual complexity of the IIR field.

Title: TaBooGa: A Hybrid Learning App to Support Children's Reading Motivation

Abstract: In this paper we present TaBooGa (Tangible Book Game), a hybrid learning application we developed to increase children's reading motivation. As children are exposed to digital devices early on (e.g., smart phones and tablets) weak readers are particularly apt to prefer digital offers over reading traditional books. Prior work has shown that ebooks can partially address this challenge by making reading more compelling for children. In this work we show that augmenting ebooks with tangible elements can further increase the reading motivation. In particular, we embed tangible elements that allow for navigating through the book as well as in the form of mini-games that interlace the reading task. We report on the results of an evaluation among 22 primary school pupils, comparing the influence of the approach on both strong and weak readers. Our results show a positive influence beyond reading motivation on both weak and strong readers. Yet, the approach requires to strive a balance between the tangible elements being motivating while at the same time not being too distracting.

Title: Virtual Reality MRI: Playful Reduction of Children's Anxiety in MRI Exams

Abstract: Many people, especially children, perceive MRI exams as threatening. They experience anxiety and stress during the procedure. Often this results in premature termination of the scan or low image quality. To avoid these adverse effects, it is common to sedate anxious patients. We present a playful virtual reality (VR) application for children (8 - 15 years) to counter anxiety and avoid sedation. Our approach uses a realistic virtual MRI scanner for desensitization and habituation to the MRI exam. To compensate the limited amount of profound knowledge about the design of child-tailored VR applications, we pursued a child-centered design process. Starting with expert interviews, we iterated through several development cycles and carried out focus group testings to evaluate prototypes of the VR application. Then, we conducted a field study with 13 patients under real life clinical conditions. Although results were non-significant, tendencies indicate a drop in the anxiety level after using the application. Furthermore, the application received strong support of the participating children, and medical professionals.

Title: Collaborative Storytelling between Robot and Child: A Feasibility Study

Abstract: Joint storytelling is a common parent-child activity and brings multiple benefits such as improved language learning for children. Most existing storytelling robots offer rigid interaction with children and do not contribute to children's stories. In this paper, we envision a robot that collaborates with a child to create oral stories in a highly interactive manner. We performed a Wizard-of-Oz feasibility study, which involved 78 children between 4 and 10 years old, to compare two collaboration strategies: (1) inserting new story content and relating it to the existing story and (2) inserting content without relating it to the existing story. We hypothesize the first strategy can foster true collaboration and create rapport, whereas the second is a safe strategy when the robot cannot understand the story. We observed that, although the first strategy creates a heavier cognitive load, it was as enjoyable as the second. We also observed some indications that the first strategy may mitigate the difficulties in story creation for young children under the age of 7 and encourage children to speak more. This study suggests that a mixture strategy is feasible for robots in collaborative storytelling, providing sufficient cognitive challenge while concealing its shortcomings on natural language understanding.

Title: Between a Block and a Typeface: Designing and Evaluating Hybrid Programming Environments

Abstract: The last ten years have seen a proliferation of introductory programming environments designed for learners across the K-12 spectrum. These environments include visual block-based tools, text-based languages designed for novices, and, increasingly, hybrid environments that blend features of block-based and text-based programming. This paper presents results from a quasi-experimental study investigating the affordances of a hybrid block/text programming environment relative to comparable block-based and textual versions in an introductory high school computer science class. The analysis reveals the hybrid environment demonstrates characteristics of both ancestors while outperforming the block-based and text-based versions in certain dimensions. This paper contributes to our understanding of the design of introductory programming environments and the design challenge of creating and evaluating novel representations for learning.

Title: Designing Together?: Group Dynamics in Participatory Digital Badge Design with Teens

Abstract: Balancing the dynamics between industry, academia, and stakeholders in a participatory design (PD) project can be challenging, particularly with teens as design partners. In this reflective case study of digital badge design, we attempt to untangle complex PD work that incorporates several groups, each with their own vocabulary, area of expertise, and position in a perceived project structure hierarchy. Using participant interviews that reflect on the design process, triangulated with video, field notes, and design artifacts, we determined that the adolescent stakeholders, science center staff, researchers, and industry professionals viewed the design process through distinct lenses based on their communities of practice, which affected how they perceived the project. Our findings contribute new insight into how youth stakeholders perceive their involvement and role in participatory design practices within a complex design project.

Title: Investigating the Effects of Interactive Features for Preschool Television Programming

Abstract: As children begin to watch more television programming on systems that allow for interaction, such as tablets and videogame systems, there are different opportunities to engage them. For example, the traditional pseudo-interactive features that cue young children's participation in television viewing (e.g., asking a question and pausing for two seconds to allow for an answer) can be restructured to include correct response timing by the program or eventually even feedback. We performed three studies to examine the effects of accurate program response times, repeating unanswered questions, and providing feedback on the children's likelihood of response. We find that three- to five-year-old children are more likely to verbally engage with programs that wait for their response and repeat unanswered questions. However, providing feedback did not affect response rates for children in this age range.

Title: SPRING: Customizable, Motivation-Driven Technology for Children with Autism or Neurodevelopmental Differences

Abstract: Current research to understand and enhance the development of children with neurological differences, including Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), is often severely limited by small sample sizes of human-gathered data in artificially structured learning environments. SPRING: Smart Platform for Research, Intervention, and Neurodevelopmental Growth is a new hardware and software system designed to 1) automate quantitative data acquisition, 2) optimize learning progressions through customized, motivating stimuli, and 3) encourage social, cognitive, and motor development in a personalized, child-led play environment. SPRING can also be paired with sensors to probe the physiological underpinnings of motivation, engagement, and cognition. Here, we present the design principles and methodology for SPRING, as well as two heterogeneous case studies. The first case highlights enhanced attention and accelerated skill development using SPRING, while the second pairs SPRING data with electrodermal activity measurements to identify a possible physiological signature of engagement and challenge in learning.

Title: Intermediate-Level Knowledge in Child-Computer Interaction: A Call for Action

Abstract: Based on an analysis of all papers at IDC from 2003 to 2016 this paper urges the Child-Computer Interaction (CCI) field to start formulating intermediate-level knowledge, in the form of e.g. strong concepts. Our analysis showed that 40% of all papers at the Interaction Design and Children conference presents the design of an artefact accompanied by an evaluation (to which we will refer as 'artefact-centered' papers). While exploring the design space in the form of artefacts is important and valuable, it can be argued that those artefact-centered papers generally make a smaller contribution to the field as a whole, which is also visible in the number of citations to such papers in comparison to the number of citations to other kinds of papers. As a first step towards more intermediate-level knowledge, we have thus attempted to formulate and ground three suggestions for strong concepts in CCI, namely Head-up gaming, Collective storytelling and Remote sensing. We based these concepts on an analysis of a set of relatively often-cited artefact-centered papers from the IDC conference proceedings. The three strong concepts we present here aim to show that the artefact-centered papers presented at the IDC conference over the last 15 years potentially contain useful knowledge that should be capitalized upon. The contribution of this paper is to initiate a discussion in the CCI community on the need for intermediate-level knowledge and how this knowledge, such as strong concepts, should be generated.

Title: SpeechBlocks: A Constructionist Early Literacy App

Abstract: This paper introduces SpeechBlocks (SB): a smartphone app that allows children to explore spelling principles in an open-ended way. Children rearrange letter combinations through direct manipulations and instantly hear each combination pronounced back, whether or not a conventionally spelled word is formed. We evaluated SB with a group of 16 preschool children ages 4 and 5 in a pilot consisting of 16 sessions over the course of two months. Qualitatively, we found that (a) the app facilitated children's engagement, sense of authorship and self-efficacy, (b) SB evoked significant amount of social interactions between children around literacy activities, and (c) support of nonsense words and remixing contributed to these factors. In addition, fine-grained log data of children's interaction with the app showed promise as a viewpoint into their literacy skills and interests.

Title: Not my Gumdrop Buttons!: Youth Tool Use in Designing an Electronic Shrek-themed Bean Bag Toss

Abstract: The Maker Movement, with a novel approach to learning and conceptualizing science, could potentially increase representation from groups traditionally alienated by mainstream science. However, only a few studies have been conducted on underrepresented groups' participation in Maker projects. In this paper, we explore how a group of Latina youths, who initially expressed an aversion to STEM and had limited knowledge about circuits, created an electronic bean bag toss. Cultural Historical Activity Theory (CHAT) provided insight into how the girls delegated and accomplished Maker tasks, used or repurposed tools, and developed expertise. Analyzing video data, student work, and group exit interviews revealed the use of non-technical terms or "insider labels" for tools described within the group. The girls were aware of their switch to more scientific language when posting online and preparing for presentations. Similarly, the young women demonstrated distinct forms of comprehension within the group when creating the project (functional understanding) versus explaining to others beyond the group (conceptual understanding).

Title: Adolescent Online Safety: Moving Beyond Formative Evaluations to Designing Solutions for the Future

Abstract: We present a comprehensive and structured review of 132 peer-reviewed publications between the years of 2008 and 2015 to inform Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) researchers and interaction designers about the current and multi-disciplinary knowledge on the topic of adolescent online safety and risks. Overall, we found that the existing literature has deeply studied the phenomena around adolescent online safety through an in-depth examination of the prevalence, perceptions, behaviors, characteristics, and outcomes associated with various online risk experiences. However, very few studies have moved beyond formative evaluations that inform design to novel design interventions or summative evaluations of new designs that serve to effectively change the status quo.

Title: Constructing Meaning: Designing Powerful Story-Making Explorations for Children to Express with Tangible Computational Media

Abstract: Story-Making is a process that cultivates creative learning by combining innovative forms of storytelling and new forms of making with novel technologies. In this paper, I highlight creative experiences for engaging children in making physical representations of their personal stories using Tangible Computational Media such as paper electronics, programmable projections, and sewable circuits. By sharing examples of the artifacts and stories made by children, I describe how they construct and express personal meaning artistically, electronically, and computationally. Reflecting on Story-Making explorations with children, I share ten design practices for developing creative learning environments, experiences, and tools that broaden and deepen children's engagement with new technologies.

Title: Abandoned but Not Forgotten: Providing Access While Protecting Foster Youth from Online Risks

Abstract: Teens in the foster care system often have histories that involve severe trauma, such as physical and sexual abuse, substance use, incarceration, and early pregnancy. While studies have investigated foster teens' engagement with high-risk behaviors offline, there is a dearth of information regarding foster teens and their engagement in online activities that may facilitate increased risk behaviors. Moreover, the extent to which technology acts as a positive versus negative influence on foster youth is unclear. We synthesize the current literature on foster youth and online safety to illustrate: 1) the tensions between providing access to networked technologies versus keeping foster youth safe from risks, 2) the lack of empirical research or technology-based interventions to ensure the online safety of foster youth, and 3) the importance of pursuing future research to design solutions that can alleviate some of these tensions. Our goal is to inform researchers, designers, and educators on the importance of keeping in mind the needs of particularly vulnerable populations, such as teens within the foster care system, when designing interactive systems.

Title: Child as Protagonist: Expanding the Role of Children in Participatory Design

Abstract: We suggest that a commitment to political participatory design defines a new role for children in participatory practices--the role of protagonist. The objective here transcends the goal of giving children a voice in design, and addresses more broadly how children can be empowered to shape technological development and critically reflect on the role of technology in their practices. This re-accentuation of political participatory design to formulate the protagonist role is important, because it deepens our understanding of how children may be empowered through design. It is also timely in view of current societal challenges pertaining to training children in twenty-first century skills. Based on a case study, we illustrate how the protagonist role, based on political participatory design, can change the objective, process, and outcome measures of the design process.

Title: The Sound Labyrinth: Computers, Constructionism and Language Learning

Abstract: This contribution presents The Sound Labyrinth, which is an application software that was designed to support the learning and safeguard of Silbo Gomero, a whistled from of language. Once used by the islanders of La Gomera, this unique form of communication has been revived, shifting from the fields where it was once used by agricultural laborers and into the space of the classroom. Here, it has integrated the school curriculum, providing children with a unique opportunity to engage with local intangible heritage. As a response to this transformation, the island's educational community has identified a new challenge: the need to develop didactic materials that resonate with the generational interests of local children. Drawing on the work Papert, Bamberger, amongst others, this contribution presents and discusses the application software that was designed in response to this challenge. Pushing the boundaries of constructionism, this contribution equally demonstrates how software might contribute to the domain of linguistic heritage.

Title: Blending Methods: Developing Participatory Design Sessions for Autistic Children

Abstract: Over the past two years, we have engaged autistic children in a participatory design (PD) process to create their own, individual smart object. In this paper, we reflect on our methodological choices and how these came about. Describing the design process with one of our participants as a case, we show how we developed participatory activities by combining, blending, re-interpreting and adapting techniques and tools from a pool of methods on the basis of the characteristics of the child, our own skills as designers and the history and context of our collaboration. Reflecting on this practice retrospectively, we seek to make two contributions: firstly, we distill a repertoire of methodological building blocks which draw on our experience of co-designing with autistic children. Secondly, we present a visual tool that captures the process by which we combined, blended and interpreted these building blocks into coherent design activities with a view to provide systematic guidance for future work. While the work presented here is set within the context of designing with autistic children, we argue that the underlying approach can be applicable and useful in a wider co-design context.

Title: Persistent Memory in Repeated Child-Robot Conversations

Abstract: Persistent memory is a critical mechanism in long-term human-robot interaction. In this work, we investigate how a robot can use information from prior conversations with the same child to foster a sense of relationship over time. To address this question, we conducted a repeated interaction study with three experimental conditions: a baseline control condition, in which the robot retains no information between conversations and relies on a typical elicitation-response paradigm; a persistence condition, in which children experience the same topic flow but with some robot turns that refer back to prior shared events; and a pro-active persistence condition, in which the robot attempts to offer its own feelings and opinions pro-actively and congruently with what it knows about the child. Our results indicate age differences with respect to the measures of interest. During conversations with the robot, older children who were assigned to the persistence conditions exhibited more positive affect, while younger children showed more positive affect in the control condition. Moreover, in a set of comparative judgments among robots they had played with, children in the augmented persistence condition considered PIPER to be the most intelligent and their favorite more often than children in the other conditions, overall, but the effect was more evident in the older children.

Title: From Smart Homes to Smart Kids: Design Research for CataKit

Abstract: This paper presents the design research process of CataKit, a construction kit for children inspired by catapults, Rube-Goldberg chain reaction machines, and mechanical automata. We set out to promote children's initiative, positive risk-taking, and procedural thinking, all in the context of their bedrooms. Our motivation is to contrast the rising smart home movement in industry, which we fear may decrease children's initiative if children's bedrooms become too automated. We describe our design research process with six children followed by a low fidelity prototype design and evaluation. We present the qualitative analysis of children's reactions to the prototype and show support for our initial goals: encourage systematic exploration of mechanical concepts and initiative over automation. We hope that construction kits like Catakit will empower children to develop curiosity about the mechanical world around them, to think about risk taking as a potentially positive experience, and to think more critically about initiative in the smart home era.

Title: Designing for Massive Engagement in a Tween Community: Participation, Prevention, and Philanthropy in a Virtual Epidemic

Abstract: How can we design for more active participation and engagement in massive online virtual worlds? While many online communities, be they online games or virtual worlds, have been created or used ostensibly with learning goals in mind, relatively little has been studied about how to motivate members collectively (rather than individually or in small groups) in productive activities, especially with children and teens. To this end we describe the design and impact of a virtual epidemic in a massive online community called Whyville.net that engaged youth players in an infectious disease outbreak. Our analyses of click data captured in log files and observations reveal which factors impacted players' changes in participation, including searches for information, engagement in prevention, and donations to vaccine design. In the discussion, we address what we have learned about identity, agency and timing as levers in designing participation in massive community experiences.

Title: Augmented Games: Exploring Design Opportunities in AR Settings With Children

Abstract: In this paper we investigate how Augmented Reality (AR) technology influences children during creative content generation in playful settings. The work is motivated by the recent spread of AR and the fact that children get in touch with this technology through their smart phones very early on. To understand the consequences, we implemented an app for smart mobile devices that allows children to create treasure hunts using GPS coordinates and marker-based AR functionality. During a qualitative user study, we asked students (n=27) to create traditional (paper + art supplies) and digital (paper + art supplies + AR app) treasure hunts and compared the resulting games, among other metrics, in terms of complexity, length and types of media used. Whereas traditional treasure hunts were linear, centered around locations and delivered information with text only, digital treasure hunts were more complex, focused on visual aspects and frequently integrated storytelling.

Title: : Examining the Spectrum of Modularity in Physical Computing Hardware Tools

Abstract: Teaching physical computing has become more prevalent in the past several decades as the maker movement has popularized microcontroller kits as a way to engage students in learning about and creating with technology. Depending on the design of the kit, students can be exposed to concepts in electronics, computer science and design of computational objects. We argue that the concepts students are exposed to depend on the modularity of the hardware and software tools. We define the level of modularity based on two interdependent characteristics: transparency and affordances for interaction. The transparency affects what is hidden or visible to the learner, while the affordances for interaction regulate how users manipulate and combine elements when constructing a computational artifact. Within this study, we examine the transparency and affordances for interaction of the physical computing hardware tools. Using our findings from this examination, we layout a framework that outlines spectrum of modularity that can be provided to facilitate learning with maker kits.

Title: Toward Understanding Children's Perspectives on Using 3D Printing Technologies in their Everyday Lives

Abstract: Children are currently using 3D printers in schools, libraries, and maker-oriented spaces. As in-home use of 3D printing becomes more common, children's access to this technology will increase. Research has investigated challenges and educational opportunities around children's use of 3D printers, and has speculated on their desires. So far, little research has investigated how children perceive the opportunities of 3D printing in their everyday lives. This exploratory work presents results from a series of three Cooperative Inquiry design sessions that investigated children's anticipated everyday uses of 3D printing and how 3D printing technologies may need to adapt to meet this envisioned future. We found that children welcomed the idea of 3D printing in their everyday lives, envisioning diverse uses spanning utilitarian needs, promoting social good, encouraging play, and providing rapid interventions. We discuss the implications of these outcomes for future designers of 3D printing and modeling technologies.

Title: Kindergarten Programming Goes Mobile: Should The Next Years Be About Ubiquity?

Abstract: Over the past 50 years, since the introduction of the programmable floor turtle, the dyad learning /programming environment underwent several transformations. Each transformation brought about new questions regarding children's understanding, learning and programming performance. This paper describes results from a preliminary study analyzing the current transformation from desktop to mobile-based learning/programming by kindergarten children. Observations of children's performance and semi structured interviews with teachers were conducted. The findings unveiled three key themes, namely, changes in programmers' perspectives, changes in foci and learning patterns in different programming modes, and changes in patterns of collaboration among peers. The preliminary findings serve as basis for planning further systematic research on the design of mobile-based programming environments for kindergarten children.

Title: Designing for Parasocial Relationships and Learning: Linear Video, Interactive Media, and Artificial Intelligence

Abstract: Children today are surrounded by media characters who populate their experiences with video, audio, games, books, clothing, toys, robots, and interactive platforms -- all with growing potential for personalization, adaptivity, and intelligence. In this paper, we describe our experience designing for "parasocial" relations between children and characters using video, interactive media, and artificial intelligence (AI), with reference to related empirical research, and a theoretical model and framework within which to understand these phenomena. The goal of this paper is to spark discussion about the future of character design in the IDC community, with a view to guiding research, development, theory, and policy recommendations; and, facilitating collaboration across disciplines and industries in order to benefit children's learning and healthy development.

Title: Agency, Embodiment, & Affect During Play in a Mixed-Reality Learning Environment

Abstract: Beginning from the assumption that young children (ages 6-8) are capable of reasoning about complex phenomena [12], we set out to better understand dimensions of the Science through Technology Enhanced Play environment that provided support for children to learn about relationships between multiple levels of an emergent phenomenon [23] states of matter. We conducted interactional analysis [15] of several moments in two classrooms as students developed and refined understanding of rules that connect micro behavior of particles of water to macro understanding about states of matter. We argue that central to students' disciplinary work were (1) multiple forms of agency negotiated within the STEP environment that were deeply intertwined with (2) students' embodiment. Agency and embodiment both supported students' consensus understanding of relationships between levels of the states of matter phenomenon (3) through students' joyful and playful collaborative work. We examine several episodes in detail to explore these findings.

Title: The KOROGARU Park Series: Three Features of the Park of the Future

Abstract: This paper reports the findings made during the operation of the KOROGARU Park series, a series of temporary park facilities featuring media technologies launched by the Yamaguchi Center for Arts and Media located in Yamaguchi, Japan between 2012 and 2016. The KOROGARU Park series has three common features: (1) Physical forms, (2) Media mechanisms, and (3) Social sprouts. In this paper, we examine the three features in detail, including description and analysis, for the complete series of five parks. While the examination, we intend to depict the potential of media technology in fostering social growth and learning in parks.

Title: Creating Environmental Awareness with Upcycling Making Activities: A Study of Children in Germany and Palestine

Abstract: This study explores the development of environmental awareness and computational literacy among children by means of upcycling making activities in Germany and Palestine. Our research supports the idea that the combination of handcraft and digital work, documentation and social interaction in the upcycling can foster the development of a maker identity in children. Findings indicate that upcycling can sensitize children for environmental issues of global relevance, foster their environmental learning and encourage them in the exploration of creative answers.

Title: Identifying Patterns in IDC Research: Technologies for Improving Children's Well-being Connected to Overweight Issues

Abstract: How is technology being designed to improve children's well-being? We address this question in connection to childhood overweight issues. On a global level, overweight and obesity among children and youth is recognized to be an alarmingly growing health challenge. We have conducted a literature review to explore how studies from the Interaction design and children (IDC) community frame health challenges related to overweight amongst children and youth. Based on the available IDC research focusing on aspects connected to overweight problems, we identify patterns in type of initiative, ages of children, context of use, kind of solution or technology, focus of the research activities and theoretical frameworks. We discuss the importance of increased research and development efforts in this area within the IDC community and call for a broader approach in terms of initiatives, research focus and application of philosophical paradigms and related theory to address a holistic understanding of children's well-being.

Title: Using Eye-Tracking to Unveil Differences Between Kids and Teens in Coding Activities

Abstract: Computational thinking and coding is gradually becoming an important part of K-12 education. Most parents, policy makers, teachers, and industrial stakeholders want their children to attain computational thinking and coding competences, since learning how to code is emerging as an important skill for the 21st century. Currently, educators are leveraging a variety of technological tools and programming environments, which can provide challenging and dynamic coding experiences. Despite the growing research on the design of coding experiences for children, it is still difficult to say how children of different ages learn to code, and to cite differences in their task-based behaviour. This study uses eye-tracking data from 44 children (here divided into "kids" [age 8-12] and "teens" [age 13-17]) to understand the learning process of coding in a deeper way, and the role of gaze in the learning gain and the different age groups. The results show that kids are more interested in the appearance of the characters, while teens exhibit more hypothesis-testing behaviour in relation to the code. In terms of collaboration, teens spent more time overall performing the task than did kids (higher similarity gaze). Our results suggest that eye-tracking data can successfully reveal how children of different ages learn to code.

Title: Bicultural: Examining Teenage Latinas' Perspectives on Technologies for Emotional Support

Abstract: Latina adolescents are one of the fastest growing demographic groups in the USA and have been found to experience higher levels of emotional distress than their non-Latino counterparts. Reliance on emotional support from the teens' social network is a common coping mechanism. While digital media is increasingly used by Latinas to communicate and express themselves, few, if any, studies have explored the perspectives of Latinas on the role of technology in helping the enactment of emotional support. In this paper, we share the perspectives of thirteen Latina adolescents (15-18 years old) that emerged through a series of participation design workshops. Our findings suggest that bicultural aspects of Latina identity can influence perspectives on the role of technology, and provide insights into attitudes towards bicultural conflicts in emotional health. We also share our participatory design technique that incorporated an ecological framework and suggestions for future use of such an approach.

Title: Supporting Interactive Youth Maker Programs in Public and School Libraries: Design Hypotheses and First Implementations

Abstract: After six months of observation at three middle school libraries and one public library implementing Maker-oriented programs, we propose four design hypotheses derived from qualitative data analysis and initial testing through design implementation. These design hypotheses address how public and school libraries serving adolescent youth can better facilitate Maker-oriented activities and are drawn from an on-going study and design project to help libraries develop interactive, technologically enriched spaces and programs to support youth exploration and creativity. Each hypothesis is illustrated with examples drawn from our observations of libraries before and after maker programs were introduced.

Title: Tangible and Shared Storytelling: Searching for the Social Dimension of Constructionism

Abstract: To reimagine Logo's ideas in the next years demands imagining ways of reinventing 'programming' in learning environments, making sense in different social contexts. The benefits of storytelling environments built with tangible technologies have shown a successful endeavor favoring the shared construction of the narratives. This article presents a computational environment based on tangible interfaces with the purpose of allowing a group of children and teachers, to create, share and tell stories together. The proposed environment was experimented within an educational context with 9 years old children and their teachers. This environment intends to illustrate the concept of socio-constructionism.

Title: The Binding of Fenrir: Children in an Emerging Age of Transhumanist Technology

Abstract: The meaning of "children's technology" is poised for imminent and radical change, as a variety of technologies are developed whose goal is to expand or augment the biological limitations of human functioning. These transhumanist technologies (including sensory augmentation, robotic bodily extensions, brain-machine interfaces, and genetic alteration) pose urgent questions for the community of designers of children's artifacts. This paper discusses the questions that transhumanist technologies raise for children's design specifically; we then present suggested heuristics for design in this new space, and outline plausible research projects consistent with those heuristics.

Title: Becoming Makers: Examining "Making" Literacy in the Elementary School Science Classroom

Abstract: This paper extends the concept of digital literacy and applies it to Making. Through case descriptions, we contribute an understanding of how children can become or fail to become individuals literate in Making within a formal learning context. Our analysis draws from video recordings and other data sources of two 4th grade classrooms in which the students, who had already participated in 1.5 years of more structured 'makified activities', engaged in an open-ended, exploration-based, and playful task that was more in line with the spirit of Making. Student teams were classified as 'high in Making literacy' and 'low in Making literacy', revealing how Making literacy was expressed at the level of skills, mental models, and practices in various ways for different students. Our qualitative analysis demonstrates what burgeoning Making literacy may mean in a public elementary school classroom, paving the way for a vision of a time when Making becomes generalized practice.

Title: Design Guidelines for Parent-School Technologies to Support the Ecology of Parental Engagement

Abstract: Parents' engagement in their children's education is key to children's academic success and social development. For many parents in the U.S., engagement is still a struggle partly due to a lack of communication and community-building tools that support the broader ecology of parenting, or parental ecology. Although current technologies have the potential to create opportunities to improve parental engagement, little is known about the impact of existing technology's design on the parental ecology. We present findings from 63 interviews with parents and an observation of existing technologies that support parent-school interactions. We found four critical issues that the design of current technologies need to address: (1) inflexibility in the boundaries of digital spaces, (2) inequality, (3) fragmentation and inconsistency of information, and (4) lack of relevant non-academic information. As a result, we propose design guidelines for technologies to support the parental ecology, and reflect on design issues that require further research.

Title: Sex Talk: Designing for Sexual Health with Adolescents

Abstract: In this paper, we describe a user-centred design process, where we engaged with 58 adolescents over an 18-month period to design and evaluate a multiplayer mobile game which prompts peer-led interactions around sex and sexuality. Engagement with our design process, and response to our game, has been enthusiastic, highlighting the rich opportunities for HCI to contribute constructively to how HCI may contribute to sexual health in adolescents. Based on our experiences we discuss three lessons learnt: lightweight digital approaches can be extremely successful at facilitating talk among young people about sex; sharing control of the conversation between all stakeholders is a fair and achievable approach; even problematic interactions can be opportunities to talk about sex.

Title: The SEL Transition Wheel: Designing for Early Childhood Social Emotional Learning

Abstract: This paper describes the design of an interactive artifact--The SEL Transition Wheel-created to support social-emotional learning (SEL) in children ages three to six. The SEL Transition Wheel focuses on helping young children learn emotional self-regulation and labeling of one's emotions while encouraging caregiver mediation of the SEL process during transition times. The final prototype presented in this paper demonstrates how a set of heuristics, identified through the design process, can be used to create interactive SEL artifacts for young children. We also discuss how the process of designing for SEL supported a multidisciplinary collaboration.

Title: Classification of Children's Handwriting Errors for the Design of an Educational Co-writer Robotic Peer

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a taxonomy of handwriting errors exhibited by children as a way to build adequate strategies for integration with a co-writing peer. The exploration includes the collection of letters written by children in an initial study, which were then revised in a second study. The second study also analyses the "peer-learning" (PL) and "peer-tutoring" (PT) learning methods in an educational scenario, where a pair of children perform a collaborative writing activity in the presence of a robot facilitator. The data obtained in the first two studies allowed us to create a "taxonomy of handwriting errors". A set of writing errors were selected and implemented in an educational activity for validation. This activity constituted a third study, wherein we systematically induced the errors into a Nao robot's handwriting using the {PT} method - A teacher-child corrects the handwriting errors of the learner-robot. The preliminary results suggest that the children in general showed awareness to the writing errors and were able to perceive the writing abilities of the robot.

Title: Making in Minecraft: A Means of Self-Expression for Youth with Autism

Abstract: Maker culture values fabrication and production in both the digital and physical realms as well as the sharing of resources. As such, maker culture provides an opportunity to be democratic and inclusive. Likewise, spaces that stem from maker culture, such as makerspaces, provide the same opportunity for inclusion, even for those with disabilities. Autcraft is a community that supports children with autism and is centered on a Minecraft virtual world that embodies maker culture. The Autcraft community's unique form of maker culture supports self-expression, sociality, and learning for children with autism by providing structure in a virtual space, allowing for and enabling creating and sharing. In this paper, we explore design implications for the creation of inclusive spaces for making and self-expression in the future based on intensive fieldwork in the Autcraft community.

Title: Drawn into Science Through Authentic Virtual Practice

Abstract: Under what conditions do students engaged with a virtual world come away with enhanced appreciation for science, wonderment about the world, and nascent understanding of science practice? Other researchers have shown that virtual worlds and games can foster such development and highlight design characteristics that elicit engagement, motivation, and learning. Our study examines what contributes to the changed interests and dispositions of learners as they engage with such worlds. Such understanding, analyzed over a diverse array of students learning in a variety of virtual worlds, is a prerequisite for developing design guidelines for drawing in students no matter the resources, interests, and attitudes they bring and help them learn and develop.

Title: Plan & Play: Supporting Intentional Media Use in Early Childhood

Abstract: Parental controls allow parents to set limits on children's use of technology, but prior work suggests that controlling children alone is unlikely to foster the development of healthy media habits. We took elements from evidence-based preschool curricula that teach self-regulation and translated them to the digital space by creating a tool for preschoolers and parents to plan their device-based playtime. In an observational lab study with 11 parent-child dyads and follow-up interviews with 14 parents, we found that children demonstrated intentionality and made goal-directed choices as they planned, the mediating factor in developing self-regulation. We observed that parents prompted their child to be intentional and solicited children's input. When children played through their plan, they transitioned to the next activity without intervention 93% of the time. Our results suggest that evidence-based practices for teaching self-regulation in a non-digital context can be applied productively to children's use of technology. As parents supported children in trying the tool for the first time, a further contribution of this work is a hierarchical model of parents' approaches to scaffolding children's use of a novel technology.

Title: Parent-Child Dialogue with eBooks

Abstract: Research shows that dialogic reading (adults and children engaging in conversation about the book they are reading) facilitates young children's language and vocabulary development and success in learning to read. A growing body of research suggests that parent-child dyads engage in less dialogic reading with e-books than with traditional paper books. Previous researchers have suggested this effect may be due to interactive features such as animations and games distracting children from the storyline, or that voice-over narration may compete with parent verbalization. The current study is the first to test this explanation directly, by comparing parent-child reading of a "feature-free" e-book with reading a paper book. Results showed that even "plain" e-books with severely limited interactive features led to less parent-child conversation about book content than reading with paper books. It is critical that these results inform parents, educators, developers, and the research community with regard to policy and practice for young children's media use.

Title: Interaction Design and Autistic Children

Abstract: With this workshop we aim to bring together researchers who explore interactive technologies in the context of autistic children. At a point at which considerable effort has been invested in this area and results are promising, but hardly conclusively convincing, we argue that it is time to critically reflect on our work. We do this by posing three provocative questions: 1) Are we trying to do the right thing? 2) Is it working? and 3) Does it matter? With all three questions we aim to kick-start a debate about the goals and intentions with which research is done in this area, how we define that technology is successful and how we can ensure that our research has real-world impact beyond the people involved directly.

Title: The Haptic Bridge: Towards a Theory for Haptic-Supported Learning

Abstract: Haptic force feedback systems are unique in their ability to dynamically render physical representations. Although haptic devices have shown promise for supporting learning, prior work mainly describes results of haptic-supported learning without identifying underlying learning mechanisms. To this end, we designed a haptic-supported learning environment and analyzed four students who used it to make connections between two different mathematical representations of sine and cosine: the unit circle, and their graph on the Cartesian plane. We highlight moments where students made connections between the representations, and identify how the haptic feedback supported these moments of insight. We use this evidence in support of a proposed theoretical and design framework for educational haptics. This framework captures four types of haptic representations, and focuses on one -- the haptic bridge -- that effectively scaffolds sense-making with multiple representations.

Title: Playing Together: The Importance of Joint Engagement in the Design of Technology for Children

Abstract: In this workshop, we will be discussing real world case studies, as well as theoretical approaches used by researchers, designers, and academics to design technology for children that includes and fosters co-play and JME experiences. Our discussion will be centered not only on understanding what are co-engagement experiences, but also how these are produced and why these are important for the child end user. The expected outcome of the workshop will be a set of principles, examples, and guidelines for digital media developers to consider when designing rich digital experiences that take into consideration not only the child, but the context for engagement as well.

Title: Of Kittens and Kiddies: Reflections on Participatory Design with Small Animals and Small Humans

Abstract: Participatory Design with children strives to broaden the perspective of and increase empathy in design for the needs and desires of children by giving children a voice in the design process. The exact nature of the role played by children in the design process (e.g. user, informant, co-designer) and how much voice they are actually given has been the subject of a long and heated debate in the IDC community. The emerging field of Animal Computer Interaction, which seeks to empower animals through the participatory design of user-centered technology, offers an interesting opportunity for a comparative analysis. Indeed, working with animals poses many of the challenges also posed by working with children, due to similarities with regards to cognitive capabilities or attention span at particular developmental stages, and with regards to the designer's ability to communicate with them. This workshop aims to bring together researchers from the fields of animal and child computer interaction to explore similarities and difference in the challenges they face, the methods they use and the lessons they have learnt, to date, with the objective of gaining a better understanding of these important aspects and setting an agenda for further collaboration and study between the two communities.

Title: Make2Learn with IoT: Engaging Children into Joyful Design and Making of Interactive Connected Objects

Abstract: The Make2Learn workshop aims to explore the introduction in the learning processes of tools and methods for creative and joyful ideation, design and prototyping of Internet of Things (IoT) artifacts. Making IoT artefacts enable children to foster co-creativity and joy in learning processes and to construct knowledge; leading to STEM concepts. Making activities for IoT often have a broad perspective that includes not just digital fabrication, but also design thinking concepts such as problem elaboration, brainstorming, ideation and reflection. Make2learn aims to bring together a multidisciplinary group of experts for exploring how the intersection between the design, making, learning and IoT fields can accelerate the acquisition of 21st Century learning competences. During the workshop a set of tools and methods to engage children in ideation and prototyping of IoT artefacts will be demonstrated. Participants are also invited to bring and present their own tools. This will allow us to better understand and improve the value of Maker philosophy and the role of design and making IoT technologies to support teaching and learning.

Title: Equity & Inclusivity at IDC

Abstract: In this one-day workshop, we aim to bring together a community of researchers at the Interaction Design and Children (IDC) conference who will share how they already make or plan to make equity-promoting fairness by allocating more resources and opportunities to those who need it? and inclusivity? the inclusion and meaningful participation of people who might otherwise be excluded or marginalized? foundational to their research with children and families. By discussing theoretical and practice-based approaches, providing feedback on each other's research, and collectively identifying concerns and challenges in addressing equity and inclusivity when doing and assessing research in IDC, we intend to do twofold. First, we will build our understanding of how our approaches, designs, and/or methods may either be restricting or facilitating equitable access and participation of diverse children and their families. Second, we will work to establish and articulate approaches to our research that forefront equity and inclusivity, taking into account how intersecting identities affect how the children and families with whom we work have or do not have access to various sources of power.

Title: Analyzing Children's Contributions and Experiences in Co-design Activities: Synthesizing Productive Practices

Abstract: Today, it has been broadly acknowledged in the CCI community that children are not only active learners and users of technology, but can also actively participate in the design process. However, it remains challenging to analyze children's experiences and creative contributions resulting from co-design activities (e.g. stories, paper prototypes, enacted ideas). Broadly speaking, a distinction can be made between researchers looking for inspiration in the form of useful design ideas, and researchers that take a more interpretative stance by looking beyond the surface level of children's ideas to better understand and empathize with them. This knowledge about children is often used to more accurately define the problem space at the early stages of design. Both perspectives to co-design can be seen as the opposite ends of the same continuum, and many researchers combine aspects of both depending on where they are in the design process (e.g. defining the design problem, prototyping stage). This workshop will explore different ways to analyze children's (0 to 18 years) experiences and contributions in co-design activities, the perceived benefits and challenges of these approaches, and will serve as a venue for synthesizing productive practices that will move the CCI community forward.

Title: Exploring and Evaluating Sound for Helping Children Self-Regulate with a Brain-Computer Application

Abstract: Children in North America are more likely to suffer from attentional challenges than any other mental health issue. Studies suggest that neurofeedback treatments may be useful for helping these children learn to self-regulate. Applying neurofeedback treatments in real-world, school settings poses a challenge, however, as these environments are often noisy and filled with distractions. The addition of ambient audio to neurofeedback systems may help reduce these disruptions. Further, research suggests that certain auditory treatments, such as binaural beats and white noise, may improve children's focus and aid memory recall. In the following paper we present the theories supporting this idea as well as a mixed methods framework for evaluating whether sound can help children focus while learning to self-regulate using a neurofeedback system. Specifically, we wish to investigate whether these treatments may help children (1) achieve an attentive state sooner and (2) maintain an attentive state for longer, when compared to the same system without sound.

Title: Teaching and Learning of Chinese History in Minecraft: A Pilot Case-Study in Hong Kong Secondary Schools

Abstract: Minecraft is the best-selling and the most popular digital sandbox games, allowing children to freely create their own buildings and objects. It has been widely used in education. In this research, we developed a real-scale Forbidden City in Minecraft, as a history education platform for Hong Kong secondary schools. The platform allows teachers to manage the class in Minecraft, meanwhile preserving the freedom for students to explore, collaborate, and create. We piloted the platform with 3 teachers and 50 students, and collected feedbacks on the teaching and the learning experience, for future development.

Title: Children's Views on Identification and Intention Communication of Self-driving Vehicles

Abstract: One of the major reasons behind traffic accidents is misinterpretation among road users. Self-driving vehicles are expected to reduce these accidents, given that they are designed with all road users in mind. Recently, research on the design of vehicle-pedestrian communication has emerged, but to our knowledge, there is no research published that investigates the design of interfaces for intent communication towards child pedestrians. This paper reports the initial steps towards the examination of children's views and understandings about the appearance and intention communication of self-driving vehicles. It adopts a design inclusive methodological approach for the development of a prototype for the communication of two basic intentions: "I am going to stop" and "I am going to proceed". The initial results indicate children's need to be aware about the autonomy of the vehicle and the use of their previous experience with traffic signs for the interpretation of communicative signs of the vehicle.

Title: Youth Reasoning With Interactive Data Visualizations: A Preliminary Study

Abstract: Youth interact with data constantly through visualizations on social feeds and news sites. Unlike traditional graphs that are the focus of school instruction, visualizations use context rich and interactive methods to create narratives and allow users to explore data for themselves. We ask: How do youth make sense of interactive data visualizations? Nine participants ages 12-13 completed semi-structured, think-aloud clinical interviews as they worked with data visualizations about socio-scientific issues. Findings suggest learners used a variety of resources, but often did not coordinate those resources. When they did, they built deeper understandings of the visualizations and their content.

Title: Multisensory Games on Children's Empathetic Feelings and Cooperative Behavior: Developing a Kansei-Based Sensory Playground Design Workshop

Abstract: How, from childhood, can we start to develop a more empathetic and cooperative society? Based on the play value for children's social development, this research aims to back up the surge of `interactive playgrounds`, a proposal that combines the interactive attractiveness of modern multi-sensory technologies with traditional elements of playground environments. In order to understand their sensory effects, we propose a play and design team workshop with children, where we will observe if different stimulus during play activity can affect their empathetic considerations toward others and their practical collaborative behavior. On this paper, we focus on this workshop experiment plan, describing its goals, the intended tools for obtaining data with infant collaborators, and our expected results. From the results, we expect to develop guidelines for sensory stimulus usage on new interactive playground and play tools designs.

Title: YOLO, a Robot for Creativity: A Co-Design Study with Children

Abstract: This paper describes the design and development of YOLO, a social robot aimed at boosting creativity in children. Creativity is one of the most sought-after competencies as we move from industrialized economies, in which standardized knowledge was imperative, to creative economies, where the ability to innovate is crucial for the workforce. YOLO is a robot to be used by children as a tool to boost new ideas and stimulate their creativity. This paper describes how established educational strategies that enhance creativity were combined with co-designing with children as informants to reach the the prototype design of the robot.

Title: Programming Literacy: Computational Thinking in Brazilian Public Schools

Abstract: Bringing Programming to K-12 Education has been a strong tendency in Brazil and in the world. In this work-in-progress, we describe an experience in teacher training with the goal of promoting the practice of programming and the development of computational thinking in students of Brazilian public schools, through an initiative called Programming Literacy. Here we present strategies used in the implementation of the initiative, design of a curricular structure and training program, as well as monitoring and evaluation strategies. The results and findings of the initiative, involving more than 500 students from four cities in 2016, are shared as well as the perspectives on next steps.

Title: Cracking The Code: The Impact of Computer Coding on the Interactions of a Child with Autism

Abstract: This paper reports on the communication patterns of two students in two settings: the elementary school classroom and the computer lab. One child was diagnosed with autism and the other was neurotypical. These students participated in a computer science curriculum designed for upper elementary school children (grades 4-5; ages 9-10), featuring block-based coding. The computer science instruction occurred in an inclusive general education setting. Analysis of video data revealed the child with autism communicated more (in terms of both total time speaking and interactions initiated) in the computer lab than was observed in the traditional classroom setting. Opposite trends were observed for the neurotypical child.

Title: Designing a Robot Companion for Children with Neuro-Developmental Disorders

Abstract: The paper describes the design of a robot companion for children with Neurodevelopmental Disorders. This work; being informed by general design guidelines reported in the current literature, lessons learned from our own previous experience, meetings with a team of therapists and special educators, and a comparison with 21 well-known robots; shows that the combination of robots' design features and roles would eventually made a robot companion unique and potentially powerful with respect to existing robots for this target group.

Title: Bots for Tots: Girls' Perceived Versus Actual Competency in Technology and Making

Abstract: This study explores how young girls perceive technology and making as part of their identity. The data presented here is part of a larger study on 38 fourth grade students (aged 9-11) taking an Engineering and Design class at an all-girls private school in a suburban area in the North-Eastern USA. Most of the girls we interviewed expressed little to no confidence in working with technology or maker activities. When asked, "were you good at technology?" They perceived themselves as someone who was not good at technology and felt as though others were much more competent than them. These expressed self-perceptions were consistent with previous findings in regards to gender and technology. However, when the girls were asked to design and identify tools that required knowledge of technology and making, they were able to demonstrate deep understanding and descriptions that supported their competency in both fields. They also shared prior experiences of engaging with technology, which contradicts their claim to be novices in these fields.

Title: Wearable Immersive Virtual Reality for Children with Disability: a Case Study

Abstract: Our research explores the potential of Wearable Immersive Virtual Reality (WIVR) as learning tool for children with disability, particularly Neurodevelopmental Disorder (NDDs). NDD is characterized by severe and often co-existing deficits in the cognitive, emotional, and motor areas. The paper discusses the learning potential of WIVR and presents the design and preliminary evaluation of Wildcard, a novel WIVR system designed in cooperation with NDD specialists. Virtual environments are displayed on a smartphone placed inside a commercial low cost VR viewer while children interact with the virtual world through gaze focus and direction. An exploratory study performed at a care center sheds a light on the behavior of children with NDDs in wearable immersive virtual reality environments and highlights the learning potential as well as the possible difficulties of using this technology with this target group.

Title: TunePad: Computational Thinking Through Sound Composition

Abstract: Computational thinking skills will be important for the next generation of students. However, there is a disparity in the populations joining the field. Integrating computational thinking into artistic fields has shown to increase participation in computer science. In this paper, we present our initial design prototype for TunePad, a sound composition tablet application controlled by a block-based programming environment. TunePad is designed to introduce learners to computational thinking and to prepare them for text-based coding environments. From our preliminary testing, with children ages 7-14, we observed that our design actively engages learners and communicates how the programming blocks control the sounds being played. This testing is a prelude to more formal studies as we continue to improve the design and interface of TunePad. With this work, we intend to engage students in computational thinking who may not have otherwise been exposed, giving the opportunity to more people to enter the computer science field.

Title: Toward a Socio-Cultural Perspective on "Making": Pupils' Journey through Materials, People and Places

Abstract: In this paper, we describe a series of workshops conducted with first grade pupils (6-7 years old) and their teacher. These workshops aim at introducing pupils to typeface design to create a class typeface to be used both on computer and on posters. While describing the whole sequence of activities pupils engaged in, we intend to open new perspectives on "making" for general education, considering its social and cultural dimensions. Throughout this report, we highlight how such making activity can support (1) pupils' acknowledgment of complex relations between materials, people and places, (2) the connection of schools to new environments and renewed agency perspectives, and (3) the development of a class culture.

Title: Multisensory Participatory Design for Children with Special Educational Needs and Disabilities

Abstract: Participatory design techniques are used to involve children with special educational needs and disabilities in the design of video games and other artefacts, but previous research has not sufficiently addressed several issues. Among these are (1) the need to develop techniques to facilitate the involvement of children with a wider range of disabilities, including children with severe and profound intellectual disabilities (ID); and (2) the need to evaluate the potential benefits of such participation for the participants themselves, and not merely in terms of the benefits to the software or other artefacts produced. We have developed a multisensory design technique: ten children (8 - 17 years; 3 female) with a range of special educational needs (including children with severe ID) participated. Parents and teachers completed a questionnaire and reported that the technique was engaging and enjoyable for children, and that they would support the use of the technique in future.

Title: Click to Enter: Comparing Graphical and Textual Passwords for Children

Abstract: This work outlines a study comparing graphical and textual passwords. A study was conducted with 13 children between the ages of six and twelve years old. These participants created their own textual and graphical passwords for fictional Web sites and after two weeks, participants returned and attempted to recall the usernames and passwords that they created. Our preliminary results showed that graphical passwords had a lower success rate and participants were less likely to access their accounts when using graphical passwords. Whether using graphical or textual passwords, children succeeded with generalities, but struggled with specifics.

Title: D-TOX: Inducing Digital Detox for Nighttime via Smart Lamp Applied Gamification

Abstract: We present D-TOX, a user-centered design that by applying gamification to a smart lamp and mobile application reduces the frequency of smartphone usage during nighttime. Many children make use of their smartphone without any significant reason before sleep which prevents them from getting a good rest. To avoid this, we focused on developing a corrective system that removes their smartphone from their hands. We reward the user using gamification. The lamp's color and intensity varies depending on the smartphone usage which feedbacks the user. Through a user study, we confirmed the significance and usability of the device.

Title: Growing Designs with biomakerlab in High School Classrooms

Abstract: We report on the development and implementation of biomakerlab, a wetlab starter kit for synthetic biology activities in K-12. In synthetic biology, participants make their own DNA-gene by gene-and then grow their designs into real applications by inserting them into microorganisms to develop different traits and characteristics provided by the genes. High school students worked with biomakerlab to make logo designs using microorganisms they manipulated to produce differently colored pigments. Our analysis focuses on student engagement with production activities and design challenges in biomaking. In the discussion, we address differences and overlaps between traditional maker activities and biomaker activities for education.

Title: Aiding the Transition from Novice to Traditional Programming Environments

Abstract: Novice programming environments are increasingly popular as introductory tools for teaching programming. Many of these tools differ significantly from traditional programming environments and are successful in motivating novices and making it simple to start programming. However, it has been reported that students still struggle when transitioning to general-purpose languages and have difficulties learning certain concepts. In this paper, we briefly describe some of the problems novices have when learning to program and identify drawbacks to existing novice programming environments. We then present two different works in progress with features designed to keep some of the advantages of current novice programming environments but in such a way that students are led to deeper concepts. Such features include immediate feedback, loop construction, and automated identifier updating. This report references the feasibility of these approaches.

Title: The Programmable Battery: A Tool to Make Computational Making More Simple, Playful, and Meaningful

Abstract: The Programmable Battery is a tiny computer that can control motors, lights, and any devices that use dry batteries. By pressing buttons on the Programmable Battery, the pattern of on and off for the devices is recorded and played back repeatedly. Since it has limited functions but can be programmed easily without a computer, anyone can make their own computational devices anytime and anywhere. In this paper, I introduce the concept of the Programmable Battery and its workshops for elementary school students.

Title: RobIn: A Half-baked Robot for Electronics in a STEM Context

Abstract: Robotic kits in designs for STEM education are becoming popular during the last few years. However, many of them focus mainly on programming leaving aside the electronics and engineering parts of robotics. In this paper we present RobIn (Robotic Insect), a robotic design that supports the equivalent coexistence of programming, construction and argumentation processes in corresponding educational robotic activities. RobIn challenges students to change it, improve it and expand its prototype robotic skeleton by using every day and affordable materials. We also present a study where RobIn functioned as a boundary object among students from different specializations of a Vocational Technical School.

Title: A Multi-User Tabletop Application to Train Children with Autism Social Attention Coordination Skills without Forcing Eye-Gaze Following

Abstract: Social attention coordination skills are central to the overall joint attention development. Previous research for children with neurotypical developing (NT) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has largely focused on one pathway of coordinating visual attention via gaze following with a social partner. However given the much higher reluctance of individuals with ASD to make eye contact, other pathways of visual attention coordination might be more satisfying. Such a possible pathway might be the hand-eye coordination which was observed to lead to successful social attention coordination between physically active infants and their parents. Motivated by prior works on the benefits of tabletop-based applications for ASD children, in this paper, we unfold a multi-user tabletop pattern-matching game to train ASD children social attention coordination skills via hand-eye coupling, that is, manipulation of screen-objects (puzzles with different patterns) in goal-directed tasks is achieved by alternating eye-gaze between screen-objects in one's own private space and another one in a shared space.

Title: Emotion Recognition via Face Tracking with RealSense(TM) 3D Camera for Children with Autism

Abstract: Although there is a growing recognition of the differences, not diminished abilities, of facial affective expressivity between Typically Developing (TD) and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) individuals, which might lead to the varied recognizability of conveyed emotion by both TD and ASD individuals, little is explored on the ecological validity of these findings; that is, whether spontaneous affective facial expressions can better be produced and recognized by both populations. We aimed to address these issues in the present study, using children's cartoon clips to assess two aspects of spontaneous emotion production and recognition in a context closer to real-life children's cartoon movie watching (at home or a classroom). Based on the facial landmark data and a teacher/parent's manual emotion tags (happy), we performed a computational analysis to compare the happy emotion labels generated by the automated algorithm and the human TD rater. Two pilot studies of six ASD children revealed the potential as well as challenges of such an approach.

Title: Digital Natives and Cardboard Cubes: Co-Creating a Physical Play(ful) Ideation Tool with Preschool Children

Abstract: This presentation highlights a study on the interactive design and implications of a playful co-creation tool, Comicubes, which combines a two-dimensional blank cardboard canvas with a three-dimensional, open-ended toy medium: the cube. In our study, we tested the concept's functionality as an ideation tool suitable for different target and age groups, as well as its potential as a creative physical platform that encourages design thinking, allows for playful manipulation, and invites interaction. In workshops designed for preschool-aged children, participants were asked to create a plaything of their choice by applying various art supplies to blank cardboard cubes. The workshop findings indicate that the children in our test group, as digital natives, were able to use the Comicubes platform to co-design and create a physical plaything and develop associated play patterns and open-ended (toy) or rule-based (game) ideas for its use.

Title: Digital Fabrication as a Tool for Teaching High-School Students STEM at the University

Abstract: In the current paper is documented an ongoing education program designed at FabLab Madrid CEU (the Digital Fabrication Laboratory based at CEU University's Institute of Technology) to teach high-school students STEM in a university environment through digital fabrication technologies. Inspired by the ideas of Neil Gershenfeld and Paulo Blikstein, we are using digital fabrication as a learning tool through which we attempt to create a working educational environment to improve the motivation of the students to finish their pre-college studies and to start a career at the university. All the pedagogies that we are exploring though the programs are based on Seymour Papert concepts related to the use of technology as a building material, the need of a "learning by doing" approach, the importance of learning to learn to keep learning or the benefits of enjoying while learning.

Title: Interactive fiction: Weaving together literacies of text and code

Abstract: We propose structural parallels between textual literacy and computational literacy, and explore interactive fiction as a medium at their intersection. We designed and built a web application allowing students to read and write interactive fiction and a curriculum weaving the two literacies together. A study evaluating the curriculum found modest adoption of literacy practices from each domain. Our qualitative observations suggest a mechanism for how each literacy can support the other: incorporating computation into English/Language Arts makes it possible for students to model linguistic processes which are otherwise ephemeral. In the other direction, situating Computer Science concepts in students' identities and experiences can make them personally meaningful and address inequities in STEM education. A third study, underway, will quantify the extent to which one literacy supports growth in the other.

Title: Designing Inclusive STEM Activities: A Comparison of Playful Interactive Experiences Across Gender

Abstract: The STEM toy market is primarily designed for, and targeted to, boys. Even the Maker Movement, which has been hailed as movement for all types of people, is dominated by males. In this paper, we take a mixed-methods approach to identify the affordances of activity design that engage first through sixth grade girls in STEM play. We present data from three workshops where we tracked and analyzed 45 students' choices from one of two squishy circuits activities-free play or a socially relevant storybook design task. Using logistic regression, we show that the odds of choosing the storybook activity over free play were approximately 23 times higher for girls than for boys. Through the analysis of one-on-one interviews, we found that most girls were drawn to the storybook activity because they either wanted to help others or the design task provided them with a starting point.

Title: CodeStitch: Leveraging Analogical Encoding in a Game Space

Abstract: Computer programming is highly collaborative, whether practiced in the form of on-site pair-programming or asynchronous reusing and remixing of code. Digital games have become an attractive tool for teaching coding, yet rarely do they account for collaboration among players. The goal of this paper is to show how asynchronous collaboration can be leveraged in a game-space by facilitating players to share and compare their solution methods. By comparing and contrasting code side-by-side players are more likely to detect structural (rather than superficial) similarities and differences (analogical encoding). A pilot study involving pre-teens found that this design feature led to reflection on the differences and different affordances of the solution methods based on their deep structure.

Title: Mathematical Reflections: The Design Potential of Ensemble Performance

Abstract: This paper describes learning in new forms of mathematical activity that involve multiple, moving bodies. It reports on initial findings from interviews with participants from various disciplines, who were asked to find and make sense of emergent mathematics in performances from the opening ceremony of the 2016 Rio Olympic Games. Findings from these interviews will inform future design studies of experimental mathematics teaching and learning.

Title: Designing Towards Maximum Motivation and Engagement in an Interactive Speech Therapy Game

Abstract: Children with speech impairments often find speech curriculums tedious, limiting how often children are motivated to practice. A speech therapy game has the potential to make practice fun, may help facilitate increased time and quality of at-home speech therapy, and lead to improved speech. We explore using conversational real-time speech recognition, game methodologies theorized to improve immersion and flow, and user centered approaches to design an immersive interactive speech therapy solution. Our preliminary user evaluation showed that compared to traditional methods, children were more motivated to practice speech using our system.

Title: "Hey Google is it OK if I eat you?": Initial Explorations in Child-Agent Interaction

Abstract: Autonomous technology is becoming more prevalent in our daily lives. We investigated how children perceive this technology by studying how 26 participants (3-10 years old) interact with Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Cozmo, and Julie Chatbot. We refer to them as "agents" in the context of this paper. After playing with the agents, children answered questions about trust, intelligence, social entity, personality, and engagement. We identify four themes in child-agent interaction: perceived intelligence, identity attribution, playfulness and understanding. Our findings show how different modalities of interaction may change the way children perceive their intelligence in comparison to the agents'. We also propose a series of design considerations for future child-agent interaction around voice and prosody, interactive engagement and facilitating understanding.

Title: Scratch Nodes: Coding Outdoor Play Experiences to enhance Social-Physical Interaction

Abstract: We present the initial design process of Scratch Nodes, a sensor-based prototype designed to augment children's social-physical outdoor play. Scratch Nodes has two main components: a hardware device and a tablet-based coding environment. The prototype was designed for 8-12 year old children with the goal of encouraging physical play, social interaction, and "changing the rules" through coding. We extend prior work in the Heads-up Games (HUG) domain by adding a real-time coding environment that directly controls the hardware device, empowering children to change the game's rules in real-time. We argue that the combination of physical play, social interaction, and coding strikes the right balance between the societal need to increase outdoor play & enhance computational thinking skills on one hand and children's need to play, measure, and define their own rules on the other. We present our initial design and implementation process as well as our insights from a preliminary evaluation with six children who tested the prototype.

Title: From Parents to Mentors: Parent-Child Interaction in Co-Making Activities

Abstract: Making activities for children often take place at informal learning environments. In this context parents may join their children for co-making activity. It has been shown that this type of activity can be facilitated by educators that serve as mentors. In this paper we aim to explore parent-child interaction in the context of a co-making activity at home. Towards that end, we developed a dedicated kit that couples Automata-building with paper circuits. We also designed five activity cards as scaffolding for parents, to raise their awareness to mentoring principles. We present our design process, evaluation, and findings from eight parent-child co-making activities. Our qualitative analysis indicates the challenges and opportunities for parents as mentors in a co-making activity. We propose a two-dimensional scale that can help designers and maker-space practitioners better understand the different parental roles during a parent-child co-making activities, and the need for better tools and support materials for parents in that context.

Title: Investigating Children's Passwords using a Game-based Survey

Abstract: This work describes how a simple Android game was used to study password and username creation with children aged 7 and 8. Children answered questions, made a username and password, and then later used these to log in. The novelty is in the use of the approach as well as in the findings. The findings confirm earlier work in regards to password length, suggesting six characters as adequate, and provide preliminary evidence that most children use familiar items in password and especially username creation.

Title: Connected Spaces: Helping Makers Know Their Neighbors

Abstract: This paper presents Connected Spaces (C-S) -- a tool designed to promote collaboration in makerspaces. It also describes a pilot study designed to test C-S's effectiveness in enabling people to seek help from peers. In our pilot, some (but not all) students were able to leverage C-S's affordances. We explore both supporting and mitigating factors, and highlight design features for environments as well as tools to support divergent, open-ended exploration and learning.

Title: Autistic Children's Use of Technology and Media: A Fieldwork Study

Abstract: This qualitative field study conducted at a school for autistic children aimed to explain how low and medium functioning autistic children use technology at school. Additionally, it explored education professionals and parents' attitudes and concerns regarding technology use by children. Data-collection methods included focus groups with nine education professionals, naturalistic observations of fifteen children with autism in therapy sessions, and interviews with parents of four of the children. Results revealed that (1) children are regular users of digital technology and media, (2) there are different patterns of use of technologies with possible correlations to accessibility and behavioural manifestations of autism, (3) education professionals and parents have positive attitude towards the use of technology by the children, but also recognize disadvantages to its use.

Title: A Tattooed Bracelet for Child Vaccination Records in a Developing World Context

Abstract: Abstract This paper proposes technical solutions to collect, record, and track health vaccination records for children in a developing world context. The problem we address in this paper is very important, and often underappreciated. Our solution consists of two elements: bracelets containing NFC tags (intended to be worn by the children), and NFC enabled Android smartphones (intended to be used by the doctors) in order to manage the vaccine information contained within the bracelets. We use a tattoo design inspired by ethnography for our prototype of the NFC enabled bracelet. The visual representation of the tattoo is printed on the bracelet surface. It conveys an overall picture of the current vaccination status. Furthermore, the tattoo is the central element of the user interface of the Android App that allows the doctors to access, read, and update more detailed information about the child's vaccination status.

Title: Designing a Physical Computing Toolkit to Utilize Miniature Computers: A Case Study of Selective Exposure

Abstract: Amid today's explosion of cheap and abundant tools for Physical Computing, there is a serious neglect of design for learnability. This issue is especially important when Physical Computing is not used mainly to teach engineering skills but to foster creativity and innovation. This empirical study presents a design case study that took place while we were trying to figure out how to best integrate miniature computers like the Raspberry Pi into our "Programmable Brick" platform called the GoGo Board. Is it possible to make the new and complex functionalities, such as face detection and social media integration, learnable by beginners? The design choices show case the idea of selective exposure. This paper presents how our system works and we present a case study with secondary and high school students.

Title: An Observational Coding Scheme for Detecting Children's Usability Problems in Augmented Reality

Abstract: Handheld augmented reality (AR) is a unique medium that can be helpful for young children's entertainment and education, but to achieve the benefits of this technology, experiences need to be appropriately designed for young children's developing skills. In the current research, we are interested in identifying and quantifying the usability problems that are encountered by children using handheld AR applications. We have developed a qualitative coding scheme for detecting AR usability problems from video observations of user interactions. We then applied the coding scheme to extract usability problems encountered by children aged 5-10 years old as they played with a handheld AR game. Through triangulation with performance data, we have detected usability problems related to AR and non-AR components of the experience. Our analysis found positive and negative correlations between usability problems and child age, and found that children experienced a variety of problems such as grip and posture strains, inabilities to recover from various types of tracking loss, difficulties orienting their body around the gameboard, etc. This work is the first in a series of studies applying the qualitative coding for understanding young children's ability to use handheld AR applications.

Title: SAM: The School Attachment Monitor

Abstract: Secure Attachment relationships have been shown to minimise social and behavioural problems in children and boosts resilience to risks later on such as antisocial behaviour, heart pathologies, and suicide. Attachment assessment is an expensive and time-consuming process that is not often performed. The School Attachment Monitor (SAM) automates Attachment assessment to support expert assessors. It uses doll-play activities with the dolls augmented with sensors and the child's play recorded with cameras to provide data for assessment. Social signal processing tools are then used to analyse the data and to automatically categorize Attachment patterns. This paper presents the current SAM interactive prototype.

Title: Close the Circuit 'N Play the Electrons: Learning Electricity with an Augmented Circuit Exhibit

Abstract: In this demo, we present Spark, an augmented circuit exhibit that enables visitors to make circuits using a set of tangible components and observe a simulation of electrons flowing through the circuit. Our goal is to use multiple representations of a circuit to help convey basic concepts of current and resistance. In Spark, the electron simulation and tangible circuit components are coupled using augmented reality techniques. We developed our system through a three-year iterative design process. We tested earlier versions of the design at a science museum with parent-child dyads and found that having access to the electron simulation could benefit children to better understand the concepts of electricity. We also observed that coupling the electron simulation through augmented reality can significantly enhance the learning benefits of the exhibit.

Title: Revisiting  and : an Open-ended Interactive Physical Game with Multiple Robots

Abstract: We present a first prototype of an open-ended interactive physical game aiming at developing children's understanding of dynamic systems in a playful and embodied way. We use a swarm user interface, Zooids, developed by Le Goc et al., made of independent self-propelled elements that move collectively and react to user input. Papert promoted an active way of developing a computational literacy, through programming a turtle with LOGO, from which Resnick proposed StarLogo, a "multi-turtles" language to simulate complex systems behaviors. Our interface is positioned in between these two perspectives: it allows to physically interact with multiple "turtles", each having its own dynamic. Each Zooid can be assigned an action that will affect the system behavior. Based on this principle, our first prototype invites children to resolve situations by changing individual actions in a dynamic system.

Title: Bear Abouts: Sharing Stories across the Physical and Digital

Abstract: We have developed an interactive storytelling platform for mobile devices that encourages children to engage in story creation across both digital and physical spaces. In our pilot study we have found that when using Bear Abouts, children engage in open-ended creative activity with tablet devices, and they also retell and re-frame narratives with each other. The platform does not use external electronics hardware, and has the potential to be a low-cost option for tangible interactions. This paper provides context for the demo of the Bear Abouts platform.

Title: Energetic Alpha, Playful Handwriting Practice for Children

Abstract: Young children are enamored by screens, especially iPads and mobile devices. Apple's App Store offers close to 100,000 products aimed at young children. Many of the apps are poor quality and include in-app advertising, deficient navigation, or overly gamified elements that compete with content. Extraneous animations, sound effects, and tangential games might be appealing to a child when activated but do not add to the child's understanding of the primary content because they disrupt the coherence of the learning experience and the child's engagement? (Hirsh-Pasek et al., 2015, p. 12). In an effort to create an educational but entertaining experience we developed an iPad application called Energetic Alpha. This interactive app teaches letter writing to children by using motion design and video content to educate and reward.

Title: Children Designing Videos: Tools, Pedagogical Models, and Best Practices for Digital Storytelling and Media-Making in the Classroom

Abstract: Although video sharing is common among youth, schools are only beginning to apply digital videos and digital storytelling to formal learning. This paper presents pedagogical models, examples, best practices, and outcomes that illustrate how teachers and students design and use digital stories in knowledge creation in cross-cultural settings. The results are based on the empirical data and findings from several international pilot studies. On the one hand, working with digital video stories drove engagement. However, on the other hand, technical issues significantly lowered engagement. In addition, the video inquiry pedagogy supported inquiry learning. Students began to pose scientifically oriented questions and seek answers together.

Title: Geometris: Designing Collaborative Mathematical Interactions For Children

Abstract: We present Geometris, a collaborative embodied geometry game for 6- to 11-year-old children. As shapes are projected onto the floor, players recreate those shapes on a 6x6 feet interactive mat. At the end of each level, a geometric pattern - the result of overlaying all created shapes - is displayed. Two dimensions of user interaction-mobility and division of labor-emerged during pilot gameplay sessions. We hypothesize that these interactions offer resources for children to learn geometry concepts as well as collaboration skills.

Title: Cool Cities A Tangible User Interface for Thinking Critically about Climate Change

Abstract: Understanding the relationship between human behavior and environmental impact is an important challenge for young learners. Children can benefit from learning experiences that enable them to actively consider and negotiate the complex tradeoffs that inform global issues. To address this challenge, we propose Cool Cities: a tangible user interface (TUI) game in which children aged 7-9 design environmentally friendly cities around different social and financial objectives. Learners place game pieces on the TUI to see their environmental and financial impact, which is reflected through a responsive display for learners to evaluate their decisions in real-time. We hope that by designing a constructivist learning experience in which learners practice the complex modeling and critical thinking needed for large-scale urban planning projects, they can better relate concepts of global warming to their lived experiences and discover powerful ideas for improving the world we live in

Title: StringForce: A Forced Collaborative Interaction Game for Special Education

Abstract: In this paper, we present the forced collaborative interaction game StringForce. StringForce is developed for a special education context to support training of collaboration skills, using readily available technologies and avoiding the creation of a "mobile bubble". In order to play StringForce two or four physically collocated tablets are required. These tablets are connected to form one large shared game area. The game can only be played by collaborating. StringForce extends previous work, both technologically and regarding social-emotional training. We believe StringForce to be an interesting demo for the IDC community, as it intertwines several relevant research fields, such as mobile interaction and collaborative gaming in the special education context.

Title: DiMBI: An Interface to Connect People to Math's Big Ideas of Patterns and Relations

Abstract: Math education faces the challenge not only of how to teach math, but also of what math to teach. With the intention of promoting math's big ideas in formal and informal settings, we created DiMBI (Discovering Math's multimedia platform developed in Processing that uses reacTIVision to read users' interactions with selected tangible regular polygons (a triangle and a square). The corners of each polygon are linked with specific features that aim to promote transfer learning (colors and music). The features change as the user manipulates the objects through symmetric actions and permutation of corners. This is the first stage of our technology, which aims to bring big math ideas closer to the people, through more concrete interactions.

Title: On Active Sharing and Responses to Joint Attention Bids by Children with Autism in a Loosely Coupled Collaborative Play Environment

Abstract: Social reputation management is essential in social interactions and believed to be mediated by the intrinsic motive to preserve and improve one's social reputation. Moreover, these activities are often only loosely structured. Prior studies revealed that children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are less sensitive to social reputation than their typically developing (TD) peers, which might explain their lack of reciprocity and desire to engage in social activities, despite that their brain functions that underpin social interaction remain intact with delayed development. Little is known about their reciprocity in loosely coupled collaboration environment where Free Play (FP, rather than Enforced Collaboration, or EC) is imposed. Our study in the long run aims at addressing this issue by engaging ASD children in a collaborative puzzle game where each child has a private work-space. The present study focuses on the design and development of such an application unfolded through a series of small-scale pilot studies with Chinese children at three different autism centers in the city. Preliminary qualitative and in-game quantitative results showed that their skills in reciprocity, active sharing aiming to completing their own task, (selective) initiating and responding to joint attention bids have satisfying been remedied and optimized in such a loosely structured play environment. There are two uniqueness of our study; one lies in the design of a loosely coupled collaborative play environment; another is to quantitatively measure some joint attention skills through children's behavioral actions.

Title: The Conference of the Birds: A Collaborative Storytelling Environment for Literacy Development

Abstract: Sociocultural theories of learning regard oral storytelling as a fundamental step towards literacy development. Collaborative play can lead to richer and sustained stories among children of young age. We describe an interactive learning environment called The Conference of the Birds (CoB). By allowing two users to interact with the interface at the same time, the CoB allows children separated by physical or cultural distances to collaborate by creating narratives together. Through the CoB, children connect, cooperate and create joint stories, fostering the development of literacy, as well as collaboration and authorship skills. In this paper we describe the principles, theories and design decisions that supported the creation of the CoB, and briefly discuss how kids can collaboratively create stories in a digital environment.

Title: Tuk Tuk: A Block-Based Programming Game

Abstract: Studying computer programming helps children develop computational thinking, a problem-solving methodology that can be transferred to solve everyday problems. Additionally, exposing children to an advanced computational concept of search algorithm allows them to see how different problem-solving techniques are designed to tackle more challenging tasks, and improve their ability to solve problems. We present a block-based programming game called Tuk Tuk for children in kindergarten level (junior version), and elementary and middle school level (standard version). With Tuk Tuk, learners create a computer program in a block-based language to control a car to complete a given task, earn money, reach the next level, and unlock new coding blocks. By completing each task, learners will learn important computational concepts and algorithms, a basis of computational thinking, such as conditionals, iterations, depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS).
