Title: "A proposal to adapt the semiotic inspection method to analyze screen reader mediated interaction"
Abstract: "An interactive system with high accessibility and communicability provides many benefits to users' experience. These benefits are mainly related to visually impaired users so that they can achieve their goals in a given context of use. This study presents an analysis of the communication process of the Semiotic Engineering theory applied in the context of visually impaired people who use screen readers. The screen reader mediates the user interaction with the designer's metamessage, acting as a translator. However, the translation can often introduce problems that are not experienced by users who do not use screen readers to interact with the systems. Thus, this paper presents a proposal to adapt the Semiotic Inspection Method (SIM) to analyze the screen reader mediated interaction (SIM-SR). The method includes new steps in the segmented SIM analysis to examine the screen reader translation and the its contrast with the designer's intended metamessage. Hence, SIM-SR allows the evaluator to identify potential accessibility and communicability issues that may impact the personal experience of users interacting through screen reader mediation."

Title: "Adaptation and Automation of a Cancellation Test for Evaluation of Exploratory Visual Behavior"
Abstract: "Tests that evaluate the individual strategies of visual exploration may be useful for characterizing deviations from typical development, such as autism spectrum disorder and dyslexia. One subgroup of visual exploration tests, called cancellation tests, require the identification of specific targets surrounded by distractors. However, the lack of automated versions of these tests limit their availability to a larger audience. In the present paper, we present an automated version of a cancellation test: the car test. The test is designed to be used by specialists and to be user-friendly optimizing its application and the analysis of collected data. We evaluated the car test in a group of 6-9 y.o. infants enrolled in a private school. The results suggest the car test is effective in providing information about visual exploration strategies of infants and is in agreement with the results of similar tests found in the literature."

Title: "A study on customizing interaction in adaptable games"
Abstract: "The use of digital games allows the enjoyment of playful moments during the learning process, especially when they are aimed at specific audiences, such as people with disabilities. However, these tools often do not have functionalities that allow the customization of the interaction for each user, according to the needs evaluated by healthcare professionals. The purpose of this work is to investigate personalization characteristics of the interaction and also the interface for games in the assistive technology field. This allows the specialized professional to tailor the game to a specific patient during their session. For this, we conducted a study of the literature on adaptable games and an empirical study where we investigated three games that were developed and tested with healthcare professionals specialized in the care of children with disabilities. The results point to customization features for adaptable games."

Title: "A survey on interaction design in distributed software development"
Abstract: "The challenges of design and development of software with geographically distributed stakeholders have not been widely addressed in the literature by the human-computer interaction (HCI) community. Although there are reports of experiences about interaction design in distributed software development (DSD), it is unclear how interaction design has been conducted in DSD projects. This paper presents the results of a survey conducted with the objective of identifying the perception of professionals involved in DSD on interaction design and to verify how interaction design has been conducted in DSD. The results indicated that good practices of interaction design have been adopted in a considerable part of the DSD projects. However, communicability and accessibility have not been considered in most DSD projects. In addition, participatory methods, techniques, and practices have been little used in DSD. The results of this survey provide an overview of how interaction design has been conducted in DSD projects and present the difficulties, challenges, and gaps of interaction design in DSD. We concluded that there is a need for future research to understand interaction design in detail and develop new solutions (or adaptations of existing solutions) of interaction design for the DSD context."

Title: "A Scenario-Based Approach for Checking Consistency in User Interface Design Artifacts"
Abstract: "Keeping the consistency of requirements in different artifacts along the development process is a cumbersome activity, especially if it is done manually. Previous studies have investigated the use of User Stories to write testable requirements in order to automate the assessment of a given set of development artifacts. This paper expands the research in this field describing a scenario-based approach for checking consistency in User Interface (UI) design artifacts, modeling business and user requirements. A case study is presented as a proof of concept showing how our approach could be used to ensure the consistency of both business and task models, besides UI prototypes and scenarios. Preliminary testing results have shown that our approach is able to identify even fine-grained inconsistencies in the mentioned artifacts, allowing establishing a reliable compatibility among different UI design artifacts."

Title: "CoDesign in the Exploratory Phase of an Assistive Technology product Design to support the Teaching-Learning Process of Brazilian-Portuguese Language for Visual Persons"
Abstract: "Libras is a communication and expression language of many Visual Person (VP) in Brazil. In National High School Examination (ENEM), for candidates to a vacancy in higher education institutions, the essay must be written in Portuguese, not taking into account the first language of the candidate. This paper presents an adapted framework that groups concepts of CoDesign, technology adoption, HCI life cycle and Semantic Numbers, and also shows the results of first phase of research. This phase consists of a contextual analysis of an Assistive Technology project for Portuguese teaching as a second language for VP. The adapted framework aims to reach objectives, working with interested parts, to be accessible and potentially adopted by them. As results we have defined Interested Parts Diagram, discussed responses applied surveys and elaborated Personas. Also, it was possible to observe the relation of the PV with the Portuguese, their wishes and difficulties with ENEM."

Title: "A Systematic Mapping Study on Research Contributions on UX Evaluation Technologies"
Abstract: "User eXperience (UX) refers to quality attributes related to the feelings and emotions of the users. In order to evaluate UX, several technologies (tools, methods, techniques, others) have been proposed that range from using questionnaires to employing biometrics. However, it is essential to characterize UX evaluation technologies to obtain evidence on the contexts in which using a specific technology can provide better evaluation results. In this paper, we present the state of the art on how to evaluate the UX of software applications. We performed a systematic mapping study with an initial sample of 2101 papers from which 227 relevant papers describing UX evaluation technologies have been identified. The results suggest that there is a need for specific UX evaluation technologies that are easy and comfortable to use from the point of view of users, while supporting practitioners in the correction of the aspects that cause poor experiences."

Title: "A platform for UX assessment based on self-reporting techniques"
Abstract: "Self-report techniques for capturing User eXperience (UX) are increasingly being used in a variety of contexts. The number of appropriate tools to assist UX evaluators in performing their activities, however, is still quite small. Typically, existing tools provide only one technique, making it difficult to compare and choose the most appropriate technique for a given scenario and the sentiments to be captured. This paper presents the UXSense platform. UXSense aims to help evaluators with the task of selecting the appropriate UX technique, create the forms to execute the evaluation and offer the computational infrastructure to capture, analyze and present the data. To identify the limitations and potentialities of the platform, a pilot test was carried out with university students who were being submitted to active educational methodologies in the discipline of Human-Computer Interaction. Based on the evaluation of the results, it was collected some evidence indicating that the use of the platform can help the UX evaluators to carry out their activities in different contexts, using different techniques of UX capture and according to the types of feelings to be measured."

Title: "Do I Know What My Code is "Saying"?: A study on novice programmers' perceptions of what reused source code may mean"
Abstract: "Software development practices rely extensively on reusing source code written by other programmers. One of the recurring questions about such practice is how much programmers, acting as users of somebody else's code, really understand about the source code that they inject it in their own programs. The question is even more important for novices, who are trying to learn what programming is and how it should be practiced in larger scale. In this paper we present the results of an ongoing research using a semiotic approach to investigate how programmers send and receive, through messages inscribed in the source code of the programs they write or reuse, implicit and explicit communication about what such source code "means" to them and others. We carried out two studies with novice programmers and results suggest that source code reuse may impact the comprehension that programmers have about their own source code. In addition, how it impacts their understanding about the messages that are being communicated through their programs."

Title: "Designing oppressive and libertarian interactions with the conscious body"
Abstract: "Human-Computer Interaction literature often includes the allegory of computers oppressing users through badly designed interfaces. Analyzing this oppression relation through the critical pedagogy of Paulo Freire, it is possible to say that computers are not oppressors, yet they can be considered oppressive if one social group is using it to oppress another. This article introduces an alternative proposal that appropriates the computer as a space of possibilities to overcome oppression relations, similarly to the Theater of the Oppressed of Augusto Boal. An experiment of critical pedagogy in Interaction Design confirmed the effectiveness human body as a fulcrum to the interaction design project and as a springboard to understanding and overcoming oppressions mediated by the computer."

Title: "Best practices for Graphical User Interfaces design with interaction based on head movements"
Abstract: "The availability of various interaction devices is a reality that expands the potential of user interface design. Traditional keyboard and mouse duet are replaced for new ways of input that use user's body as a means of interaction. However, Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) are still the major output when we analyze the form of display and feedback directed to the user. Therefore, it is necessary to rethink the design of the interaction when the devices used exploit other users' abilities in order to stimulate a better experience of using these devices when in conjunction with an IGU. In this context, the objective of this paper is to propose best practices for IGU projects that use interaction based on head movement tracking. We used the results of a Systematic Review of the Literature and a practical experiment trying to compare efficiency, effectiveness, user experience and interaction characteristics."
