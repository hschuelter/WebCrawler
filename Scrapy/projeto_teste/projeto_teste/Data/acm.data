Title: "Data mining: are we there yet?"

Abstract: "Data mining started its move out of the statistics and machine learning ghettos and into the mainstream almost 10 years ago. With great fanfare and a large influx of venture capital, data mining was going to change the very nature of business. Yet data mining products have had relatively modest success in the marketplace. The reasons include limitations and misplaced emphasis in the products' features and functions, unrealistic expectations set by messages from the data mining community, and a lack of readiness by many prospective users. This session will look at where vendors have succeeded and failed with their products, what expectations users should have, and suggestions for achieving the potential of this exciting and valuable technology."

Title: "Data mining"

Abstract: "Data mining is the process of finding patterns in information contained in large databases. It is a research area at the intersection of several disciplines, including statistics, databases, pattern recognition and AI, visualization, optimization, and high-performance and parallel computing. With the success of database systems, and their widespread use, the role of the database expanded from being a reliable data store to being a decision support system (DSS). This has been manifested in the growth of data warehouses that consolidate transactional and distributed databases. Examples of applications of data mining techniques include: fraud detection in banking and telecommunications; marketing; science data analysis involving cataloging objects of interest in large data sets (e.g. sky objects in a survey, volcanoes on Venus, finding atmospheric events in remote sensing data); problem diagnosis in manufacturing, medicine, or networking; and so forth. The techniques are particularly relevant in settings where data is plentiful and the processes generating it are poorly understood."

Title: "The kaleidoscope of effective gamification: deconstructing gamification in business applications"

Abstract: "Developers of gamified business applications face the challenge of creating motivating gameplay strategies and creative design techniques to deliver subject matter not typically associated with games in a playful way. We currently have limited models that frame what makes gamification effective (i.e., engaging people with a business application). Thus, we propose a design-centric model and analysis tool for gamification: The kaleidoscope of effective gamification. We take a look at current models of game design, self-determination theory and the principles of systems design to deconstruct the gamification layer in the design of these applications. Based on the layers of our model, we provide design guidelines for effective gamification of business applications."

Title: "Toward knowledge-driven data mining"

Abstract: "This paper highlights the need to move from a method-driven approach to a knowledge-driven approach to data mining. A number of issues are covered including the need to develop 'smart' data-mining algorithms which include expert mining and modelling knowledge, the need to use 'intelligent data' or data that contains both metadata and metaknowledge, the need to marry business knowledge with technical knowledge with data mining and the need to use intelligence and other qualitative analyses to determine where data-mining efforts should be focused."

Title: "Metaheuristics in combinatorial optimization: Overview and conceptual comparison"

Abstract: "The field of metaheuristics for the application to combinatorial optimization problems is a rapidly growing field of research. This is due to the importance of combinatorial optimization problems for the scientific as well as the industrial world. We give a survey of the nowadays most important metaheuristics from a conceptual point of view. We outline the different components and concepts that are used in the different metaheuristics in order to analyze their similarities and differences. Two very important concepts in metaheuristics are intensification and diversification. These are the two forces that largely determine the behavior of a metaheuristic. They are in some way contrary but also complementary to each other. We introduce a framework, that we call the I&D frame, in order to put different intensification and diversification components into relation with each other. Outlining the advantages and disadvantages of different metaheuristic approaches we conclude by pointing out the importance of hybridization of metaheuristics as well as the integration of metaheuristics and other methods for optimization."

Title: "Metaheuristics Applied in Remanufacturing and Reverse logistics: A review"

Abstract: "Due to growing environmental concerns, a large number of companies and organizations in the world give importance to reverse logistics and remanufacturing. Remanufacturing which aims is to take care of used or damaged product in the purpose of returning it like new product, lead many researchers to study the integration of this reverse flow in the process of the forward supply chain. The resulting models are difficult and complex to solve and optimize, hence the need to integrate a strong and efficient method such as Metaheuristics to solve those complex optimization problems. The purpose of this study is to review the published literature on the issues of reverse logistics and remanufacturing, and classified these papers by the type of metaheuristic used. Also, it aims to outline some future opportunities for research based on research gap analysis."

Title: "Structure and metaheuristics"

Abstract: "Metaheuristics have often been shown to be effective for difficult combinatorial optimization problems. The reason for that, however, remains unclear. A framework for a theory of metaheuristics crucially depends on a formal representative model of such algorithms. This paper unifies/reconciles in a single framework the model of a black box algorithm coming from the no-free-lunch research (e.g. Wolpert et al. [25], Wegener [23]) with the study of  fitness landscape. Both are important to the understanding of meta-heuristics, but they have so far been studied separately. The new model is a natural environment to study meta-heuristics."

Title: "Optimization based on dynamic and hybrid metaheuristics via DEVS simulation"

Abstract: "In this paper we present an efficient decision-making framework allowing optimization via simulation combining metaheuristics algorithms and DEVS formalism. A proposed object-oriented approach provides an universal interface between any existing DEVS models and some existing metaheuristics. To do this we explode the optimization algorithms into several actions involved in an optimization loop. Concerning the evaluation step which one can find in each metaheuristic we propose to externalize it into decision models using DEVS messages. This interconnection of components generates the following new concepts: (i) event-driven metaheuristic parametrization that allows an automatic execution of the associated algorithm; (ii) creation of dynamic and hydrid metaheuristics used for hard-optimization problems; (iii) decision support variables temporization that allows optimization on a specific time interval. We validated the effectiveness of the previous concepts through the implementation of the popular genetic algorithms and the more recent harmonic search algorithm. Furthermore the validation is completed on a real case example concerning medical treatment through a simple glycemic DEVS model. Simulation results show that the resulting treatement reduces the risk of over-tratement or under-treatement."

Title: "Gamification ecosystems"

Abstract: "In this paper, we provide a general overview of the motivations behind the proposal track Gamification ecosystems. Its clear now that there is lot of different approaches available for application of games in non-leisure context. Rather than to talk about one kind of game or game system, we decided to use term ecosystem in order to be clearer and more consistent with our approach. That is to integrate different approaches and orchestrate different tools in order to make them work together. First part of the paper presents brief state of the art in the field of gamification. Second part of the paper is devoted to short presentation of each of the participating paper."

Title: "Gamification usage ecology"

Abstract: "Gamification is applied in academia and industry and is being studied in the last years. Gamification is nowadays applied to several areas, such as learning, computer science, business, marketing, tourism, among others. However, we need to understand to what extent it is studied in academic context. We present a bibliographic study on gamification research, by identifying publications trends. This paper presents the gamification related areas, result from a publication keyword analysis of the scientific publications on gamification. In this paper, we also identify the game elements, game mechanics, and game dynamics, used as part of any gamification implementation. In this study are also present the most used gamification theoretical models."

Title: "Health gamification"

Abstract: "How and whom teach healthy lifestyle to our children? Using gamification through mobile applications, children on school age could implement healthy lifestyle and it would be the method for children from an early age to accept and integrate models of life to enable them to live a long and disease free life.Health Gamification programs for adults, not only would be an educational model to persuade the person to become their lives on a healthy life, it is a way of change a task to an attractive challenge which worthwhile to continue.Gamification is also a management health and a way of encouragement of the person. Family apps, involving children and parents, and all together maintain, establish or improve their lifestyle.Thus, users with high levels of compliance and therefore with less risk of illness caused by social factors would benefit from full health coverage, and and rewarded with redeemable points system by greater health benefits, such as weekends on spas, massages, cardiovascular sports...Those users with less adherent of healthy lifestyle factors will be divided into classes of risk that will cause a higher or lower percentage of your healing is partly taken over by themselves.Gamification to educate and manage health, applied to all ages and with socio-economic integration from the goverment."

Title: "Data mining: are we there yet?"

Abstract: "Data mining started its move out of the statistics and machine learning ghettos and into the mainstream almost 10 years ago. With great fanfare and a large influx of venture capital, data mining was going to change the very nature of business. Yet data mining products have had relatively modest success in the marketplace. The reasons include limitations and misplaced emphasis in the products' features and functions, unrealistic expectations set by messages from the data mining community, and a lack of readiness by many prospective users. This session will look at where vendors have succeeded and failed with their products, what expectations users should have, and suggestions for achieving the potential of this exciting and valuable technology."

Title: "Data mining"

Abstract: "Data mining is the process of finding patterns in information contained in large databases. It is a research area at the intersection of several disciplines, including statistics, databases, pattern recognition and AI, visualization, optimization, and high-performance and parallel computing. With the success of database systems, and their widespread use, the role of the database expanded from being a reliable data store to being a decision support system (DSS). This has been manifested in the growth of data warehouses that consolidate transactional and distributed databases. Examples of applications of data mining techniques include: fraud detection in banking and telecommunications; marketing; science data analysis involving cataloging objects of interest in large data sets (e.g. sky objects in a survey, volcanoes on Venus, finding atmospheric events in remote sensing data); problem diagnosis in manufacturing, medicine, or networking; and so forth. The techniques are particularly relevant in settings where data is plentiful and the processes generating it are poorly understood."

Title: "Toward knowledge-driven data mining"

Abstract: "This paper highlights the need to move from a method-driven approach to a knowledge-driven approach to data mining. A number of issues are covered including the need to develop 'smart' data-mining algorithms which include expert mining and modelling knowledge, the need to use 'intelligent data' or data that contains both metadata and metaknowledge, the need to marry business knowledge with technical knowledge with data mining and the need to use intelligence and other qualitative analyses to determine where data-mining efforts should be focused."

Title: "Metaheuristics Applied in Remanufacturing and Reverse logistics: A review"

Abstract: "Due to growing environmental concerns, a large number of companies and organizations in the world give importance to reverse logistics and remanufacturing. Remanufacturing which aims is to take care of used or damaged product in the purpose of returning it like new product, lead many researchers to study the integration of this reverse flow in the process of the forward supply chain. The resulting models are difficult and complex to solve and optimize, hence the need to integrate a strong and efficient method such as Metaheuristics to solve those complex optimization problems. The purpose of this study is to review the published literature on the issues of reverse logistics and remanufacturing, and classified these papers by the type of metaheuristic used. Also, it aims to outline some future opportunities for research based on research gap analysis."

Title: "Data mining techniques"

Abstract: "Data mining, or knowledge discovery in databases, has been popularly recognized as an important research issue with broad applications. We provide a comprehensive survey, in database perspective, on the data mining techniques developed recently. Several major kinds of data mining methods, including generalization, characterization, classification, clustering, association, evolution, pattern matching, data visualization, and meta-rule guided mining, will be reviewed. Techniques for mining knowledge in different kinds of databases, including relational, transaction, object-oriented, spatial, and active databases, as well as global information systems, will be examined. Potential data mining applications and some research issues will also be discussed."

Title: "Structure and metaheuristics"

Abstract: "Metaheuristics have often been shown to be effective for difficult combinatorial optimization problems. The reason for that, however, remains unclear. A framework for a theory of metaheuristics crucially depends on a formal representative model of such algorithms. This paper unifies/reconciles in a single framework the model of a black box algorithm coming from the no-free-lunch research (e.g. Wolpert et al. [25], Wegener [23]) with the study of  fitness landscape. Both are important to the understanding of meta-heuristics, but they have so far been studied separately. The new model is a natural environment to study meta-heuristics."

Title: "Optimization based on dynamic and hybrid metaheuristics via DEVS simulation"

Abstract: "In this paper we present an efficient decision-making framework allowing optimization via simulation combining metaheuristics algorithms and DEVS formalism. A proposed object-oriented approach provides an universal interface between any existing DEVS models and some existing metaheuristics. To do this we explode the optimization algorithms into several actions involved in an optimization loop. Concerning the evaluation step which one can find in each metaheuristic we propose to externalize it into decision models using DEVS messages. This interconnection of components generates the following new concepts: (i) event-driven metaheuristic parametrization that allows an automatic execution of the associated algorithm; (ii) creation of dynamic and hydrid metaheuristics used for hard-optimization problems; (iii) decision support variables temporization that allows optimization on a specific time interval. We validated the effectiveness of the previous concepts through the implementation of the popular genetic algorithms and the more recent harmonic search algorithm. Furthermore the validation is completed on a real case example concerning medical treatment through a simple glycemic DEVS model. Simulation results show that the resulting treatement reduces the risk of over-tratement or under-treatement."

Title: "The kaleidoscope of effective gamification: deconstructing gamification in business applications"

Abstract: "Developers of gamified business applications face the challenge of creating motivating gameplay strategies and creative design techniques to deliver subject matter not typically associated with games in a playful way. We currently have limited models that frame what makes gamification effective (i.e., engaging people with a business application). Thus, we propose a design-centric model and analysis tool for gamification: The kaleidoscope of effective gamification. We take a look at current models of game design, self-determination theory and the principles of systems design to deconstruct the gamification layer in the design of these applications. Based on the layers of our model, we provide design guidelines for effective gamification of business applications."

Title: "Metaheuristics in combinatorial optimization: Overview and conceptual comparison"

Abstract: "The field of metaheuristics for the application to combinatorial optimization problems is a rapidly growing field of research. This is due to the importance of combinatorial optimization problems for the scientific as well as the industrial world. We give a survey of the nowadays most important metaheuristics from a conceptual point of view. We outline the different components and concepts that are used in the different metaheuristics in order to analyze their similarities and differences. Two very important concepts in metaheuristics are intensification and diversification. These are the two forces that largely determine the behavior of a metaheuristic. They are in some way contrary but also complementary to each other. We introduce a framework, that we call the I&D frame, in order to put different intensification and diversification components into relation with each other. Outlining the advantages and disadvantages of different metaheuristic approaches we conclude by pointing out the importance of hybridization of metaheuristics as well as the integration of metaheuristics and other methods for optimization."

Title: "Health gamification"

Abstract: "How and whom teach healthy lifestyle to our children? Using gamification through mobile applications, children on school age could implement healthy lifestyle and it would be the method for children from an early age to accept and integrate models of life to enable them to live a long and disease free life.Health Gamification programs for adults, not only would be an educational model to persuade the person to become their lives on a healthy life, it is a way of change a task to an attractive challenge which worthwhile to continue.Gamification is also a management health and a way of encouragement of the person. Family apps, involving children and parents, and all together maintain, establish or improve their lifestyle.Thus, users with high levels of compliance and therefore with less risk of illness caused by social factors would benefit from full health coverage, and and rewarded with redeemable points system by greater health benefits, such as weekends on spas, massages, cardiovascular sports...Those users with less adherent of healthy lifestyle factors will be divided into classes of risk that will cause a higher or lower percentage of your healing is partly taken over by themselves.Gamification to educate and manage health, applied to all ages and with socio-economic integration from the goverment."

Title: "Gamification ecosystems"

Abstract: "In this paper, we provide a general overview of the motivations behind the proposal track Gamification ecosystems. Its clear now that there is lot of different approaches available for application of games in non-leisure context. Rather than to talk about one kind of game or game system, we decided to use term ecosystem in order to be clearer and more consistent with our approach. That is to integrate different approaches and orchestrate different tools in order to make them work together. First part of the paper presents brief state of the art in the field of gamification. Second part of the paper is devoted to short presentation of each of the participating paper."

Title: "Gamification usage ecology"

Abstract: "Gamification is applied in academia and industry and is being studied in the last years. Gamification is nowadays applied to several areas, such as learning, computer science, business, marketing, tourism, among others. However, we need to understand to what extent it is studied in academic context. We present a bibliographic study on gamification research, by identifying publications trends. This paper presents the gamification related areas, result from a publication keyword analysis of the scientific publications on gamification. In this paper, we also identify the game elements, game mechanics, and game dynamics, used as part of any gamification implementation. In this study are also present the most used gamification theoretical models."
