Title: "Distributed vector Processing of a new local MultiScale Fourier transform for medical imaging applications"

Abstract: "The recently developed S-transform (ST) combines features of the Fourier and Wavelet transforms; it reveals frequency variation over both space and time. It is a potentially powerful tool that can be applied to medical image processing including texture analysis and noise filtering. However, calculation of the ST is computationally intensive, making conventional implementations too slow for many medical applications. This problem was addressed by combining parallel and vector computations to provide a 25-fold reduction in computation time. This approach could help accelerate many medical image processing algorithms."

Title: "Sequence Pattern Mining with Variables"

Abstract: "Sequence pattern mining (SPM) seeks to find multiple items that commonly occur together in a specific order. One common assumption is that the relevant differences between items are captured through creating distinct items. In some domains, this leads to an exponential increase in the number of items. This paper presents a new SPM, Sequence Mining of Temporal Clusters (SMTC), that allows item differentiation through attribute variables for domains with large numbers of items. It also provides a new technique for addressing interleaving, a phenomena that occurs when two sequences occur simultaneously resulting in their items alternating. By first clustering items temporally and only focusing on sequences after the temporal clusters are established, it sidesteps the traditional interleaving issues. SMTC is evaluated on a digital forensics dataset, a domain with a large number of items and frequent interleaving. Its results are compared with Discontinuous Varied Order Sequence Mining (DVSM) with variables added (DVSM-V). By adding variables, both algorithms reduce the data by 96 percent, and identify 100 percent of the events while keeping the false positive rate below 0.03 percent. SMTC mines the data in 20 percent of the time it takes DVSM-V and provides a lower false positive rate even at higher similarity thresholds."

Title: "Filter-based coded-excitation system for high-speed ultrasonic imaging"

Abstract: "The authors have recently presented a new algorithm for high-speed parallel processing of ultrasound pulse-echo data for real-time three-dimensional (3-D) imaging. The approach utilizes a discretized linear model of the echo data received from the region of interest (ROI) using a conventional beam former. The transmitter array elements are fed with binary codes designed to produce distinct impulse responses from different directions in ROI. Image reconstruction in ROI is achieved with a regularized pseudoinverse operator derived from the linear receive signal model. The reconstruction operator can be implemented using a transversal filter bank with every filter in the bank designed to extract echoes from a specific direction in the ROI. The number of filters in the bank determines the number of image lines acquired simultaneously. In this paper, the authors present images of a cyst phantom reconstructed based on their formulation. A number of issues of practical significance in image reconstruction are addressed. Specifically, an augmented model is introduced to account for imperfect blocking of echoes from outside the ROI. The authors have also introduced a column-weighting algorithm for minimizing the number of filter coefficients. In addition, a detailed illustration of a full image reconstruction using subimage acquisition and compounding is given. Experimental results have shown that the new approach is valid for phased-array pulse-echo imaging of speckle-generating phantoms typically used in characterizing medical imaging systems. Such coded-excitation-based image reconstruction from speckle-generating phantoms, to the best of the authors' knowledge, have not been reported previously."

Title: "Apparent Ultra-High $b$ -Value Diffusion-Weighted Image Reconstruction via Hidden Conditional Random Fields"

Abstract: "A promising, recently explored, alternative to ultra-high b-value diffusion weighted imaging (UHB-DWI) is apparent ultra-high b-value diffusion-weighted image reconstruction (AUHB-DWR), where a computational model is used to assist in the reconstruction of apparent DW images at ultra-high b-values. Firstly, we present a novel approach to AUHB-DWR that aims to improve image quality. We formulate the reconstruction of an apparent DW image as a hidden conditional random field (HCRF) in which tissue model diffusion parameters act as hidden states in this random field. The second contribution of this paper is a new generation of fully connected conditional random fields, called the hidden stochastically fully connected conditional random fields (HSFCRF) that allows for efficient inference with significantly reduced computational complexity via stochastic clique structures. The proposed AUHB-DWR algorithms, HCRF and HSFCRF, are evaluated quantitatively in nine different patient cases using Fisher's criteria, probability of error, and coefficient of variation metrics to validate its effectiveness for the purpose of improving intensity delineation between expert identified suspected cancerous and healthy tissue within the prostate gland. The proposed methods are also examined using a prostate phantom, where the apparent ultra-high b-value DW images reconstructed using the tested AUHB-DWR methods are compared with real captured UHB-DWI. The results illustrate that the proposed AUHB-DWR methods has improved reconstruction quality and improved intensity delineation compared with existing AUHB-DWR approaches."
